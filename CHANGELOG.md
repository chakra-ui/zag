# CHANGELOG

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

> For v0.x changelog, see the [v0 branch](https://github.com/chakra-ui/zag/blob/v0/CHANGELOG.md)

## [1.23.0](./#1.23.0) - 2025-09-11

### Added

- **Dismissable**: Add support for layer types in dismissable layer stack. Layers can now be categorized as `dialog`,
  `popover`, `menu`, or `listbox`. This enables:
  - `data-nested` attribute on nested layers of the same type
  - `data-has-nested` attribute on parent layers with nested children of the same type
  - `--nested-layer-count` CSS variable indicating the number of nested layers of the same type

### Fixed

- **Core**: Fix issue where `mergeProps` strips symbols after merging

- **Dom Query**:
  - Fix issue where `isActiveElement` checks don't consider the Shadow DOM
  - Fix issue where `getActiveElement` returns `activeElement` rather than `null` for focusable web components with no
    focusable children

- **Menu**: Fix issue where hovering a partially visible item with pointer causes it to scroll into view

- **Tabs**: Fix issue where `ids` for `item` and `content` could not be customized

- **Toast**: Allow creating a toast store without any arguments

  ```tsx
  // before
  const store = toast.createStore({})

  // after
  const store = toast.createStore()
  ```

## [1.22.1](./#1.22.1) - 2025-08-27

### Fixed

- **Collection**: Fix issue where disabled items could be reached via typeahead

- **Date Picker**: Fix issue where datepicker doesn't revert to a valid value when the input value exceeds the min/max
  and blurred

- **Tags Input**: Fix issue where highlighted item doesn't clear when tabbing out of the input to an external button
  within the `control` part.

## [1.22.0](./#1.22.0) - 2025-08-26

### Added

- **Hover Card**: Add support for `disabled` prop

### Fixed

- **Color Picker**: Fix issue where color picker was not working correctly in RTL mode

- **Dismissable**: Expose `onRequestDismiss` custom event handler for event a parent layer requests the child layer to
  dismiss. If prevented via `event.preventDefault()`, the child layer will not dismiss when the parent layer is
  dismissed.

- **Number Input**
  - Omit the input `pattern` when `formatOptions` is provided. This prevents native pattern validation from conflicting
    with formatted values (e.g., currency or percent).
  - Handle empty values consistently across all format options.
  - Add `data-scrubbing` attribute to the number input parts.

- **Tooltip**
  - Set `closeOnPointerdown` to `false` when `closeOnClick` is set to `false`
  - Reduce bundle size by replacing `@zag-js/store` dependency with a lightweight store implementation.

## [1.21.9](./#1.21.9) - 2025-08-23

## Fixed

- **Async List**:
  - Fixed critical race conditions and dual operations in sort functionality that could cause stale data overwrites and
    unexpected behavior
  - Fixed event handling during async operations - users can now properly interrupt sorting with RELOAD, FILTER, or new
    SORT events
  - Enhanced `SortDetails` interface with `filterText` parameter for consistent filtering context across local and
    server-side operations

## [1.21.8](./#1.21.8) - 2025-08-22

### Fixed

- **Date Picker**:
  - Clear hovered range state after completing range selection instead of waiting for pointer to leave the calendar
    area.
  - Fix issue where month and year select labels don't update correctly when using `min`/`max` constraints.
  - Expose `disabled` on `api.getMonths()` and `api.getYears()` results to indicate options out of range for current
    constraints.

- **Listbox**:
  - Fix issue where first enabled item should be highlighted by default when listbox receives focus and no item is
    currently highlighted.
  - Add `getElement` to `scrollToIndexFn` details

- **Scroll Area**:
  - Avoid detecting hover state from portalled descendants.

  developers to show loading states during file processing.

### Fixed

## [1.20.0](./#1.20.0) - 2025-07-22

  particularly in scenarios involving time components.

### Added

- **Date Picker**: Added hover range preview support for date picker range selection. Added `inHoveredRange`,
  `firstInHoveredRange`, and `lastInHoveredRange` properties to `DayTableCellState` with corresponding data attributes
  `data-in-hover-range`, `data-hover-range-start`, and `data-hover-range-end`.

  Hover range states are only active when not overlapping with actual selected range, enabling distinct styling for
  hover preview vs actual selection in range mode.

  types

    extension.

### Changed

- **Collection**: Improve the APIs around `tree.flatten(...)` and `flattenedToTree` to ensure the original node

    collection,
    async loadChildren({ valuePath, signal }) {
