## [Unreleased]

See the [Changesets](./.changeset) for the latest changes.

## [1.0.2](./#1.0.2) - 2025-02-24

### Fixed

- **Collection**: Widen `items` type to allow `Iterable` instead of just `Array` since we internally convert iterables
  to an array.

- **Carousel**: Enforce required `slideCount` to ensure machine works as expected.

- **Framework Bindings**: Fix issue where `undefined` values were not filtered out before resolving props.

- **React**: Fix issue where `flushSync` warnings could be shown when unmounting a component.

## [1.0.1](./#1.0.1) - 2025-02-23

### Fixed

- **Select**: Fix regression where `multiple: true` doesn't work.

- **Timer**: Fix issue where timer doesn't restart when `startMs` changes.

- **Toggle Group**: Fix issue where `data-focus` doesn't get removed after blurring the toggle group.

- **Toast**: Fix keyboard navigation issue where toast group skips the close button within the toast item and moves to
  the next focusable element in the document.

### Added

- Added `<component>.Machine` type to help when typecasting generic components like combobox and select.

## [1.0.0](./#1.0.0) - 2025-02-22

### Changed

  performance improvements across components.

  - Require the creation of a toast store using `createStore`
  - **Solid.js**: Require the usage of `<Key>` component to render toasts

### Fixed

- **Menu**: Fix issue where context menu doesn't update positioning on subsequent right clicks.

- **Avatar**: Fix issue where `api.setSrc` doesn't work.

- **File Upload**: Fix issue where drag-and-drop doesn't work when `directory` is `true`.

- **Carousel**

  - Fix issue where initial page is not working.
  - Fix issue where pagination sync broken after using dots indicators.

- **Timer**: Fix issue where timer stops when switching tabs.
