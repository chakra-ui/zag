Add `onVisibleRangeChange` callback to notify when the visible date range changes.

This callback fires when:

- Clicking next/prev triggers
- Selecting a month from the month dropdown
- Selecting a year from the year dropdown
- Focusing a date outside the current visible range
- Any other action that changes the visible range
