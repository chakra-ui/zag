  [@segunadebayo](https://github.com/segunadebayo)! - BREAKING ðŸ’¥: Refactor connect function in favor of uniform APIs
  across frameworks

  Due to the fact that we tried to make "React" the baseline, there was a lot of inherent complexity in how we managed
  types in the codebase.

  We've now removed the `PropTypes` export in favor of passing `normalizeProps` in the `api.connect` function. This is
  now required for React as well.

  You can remove the `<PropTypes>` generic and Zag will auto-infer the types from `normalizeProps`.

  **For Vue and Solid**

  ```diff
  -api.connect<PropTypes>(state, send, normalizeProps)
  +api.connect(state, send, normalizeProps)
  ```

  **For React**

  ```diff
  -api.connect(state, send)
  +api.connect(state, send, normalizeProps)
  ```
