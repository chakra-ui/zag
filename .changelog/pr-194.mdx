## Patch Changes

### All frameworks

- Remove `useSetup` hook to improve server-side rendering (SSR) for all frameworks

### Core `0.1.8`

- Fix order of execution between root entry-exit and initial state

### PinInput `0.1.10`

- Add support for `pattern` in machine context to allow consumer define their own patterns to validate against.

```jsx
const [state, send] = useMachine(
  pinInput.machine({
    pattern: "^[0-9.-]+$",
  }),
)
```

- Improve form support by exposing `hiddenInputProps`. When the machine is passed a `name` property:
  - The `input` element with `api.hiddenInputProps` is attached will send updates to the closest `form` element.
  - When the pin input's value is complete and the `Enter` key is pressed, the closest `form` will be submitted.
