## Patch Changes

### All frameworks

**BREAKING ðŸ’¥**

Refactored `connect` function to ensure a uniform APIs across frameworks

Due to the fact that we tried to make "React" the baseline, there was a lot of inherent complexity in how we managed
types in the codebase.

We've now removed the `PropTypes` export in favor of passing `normalizeProps` in the `api.connect` function. This is now
required for React as well.

You can remove the `<PropTypes>` generic and Zag will auto-infer the types from `normalizeProps`.

**For Vue and Solid**

```diff
-api.connect<PropTypes>(state, send, normalizeProps)
+api.connect(state, send, normalizeProps)
```

**For React**

```diff
-api.connect(state, send)
+api.connect(state, send, normalizeProps)
```

### Checkbox `0.1.1`

- Update `inputProps` to use `defaultChecked` instead of `checked` for progressive enhancement

### Combobox `0.1.9`

- Use option `value` to handle component logic instead of `label`, to account for usecases where label could be the
  same. e.g. a list of people where some might have the same names.
