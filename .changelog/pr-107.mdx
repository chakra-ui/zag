## Patch Changes

### Core `0.1.5`

- Extend guard expression to support in guards. In Guards are guards that asserts that a machine is in a given state
  before executing the transition. [Learn more](https://statecharts.dev/glossary/guard.html#in-and-not-in-guards)

  This helper can be used in inline guards or the gaurds options.

  ```js
  import { guards } from "@zag-js/core"

  const { isIn } = gaurds

  const machine = createMachine({
    on: {
      CLICK: {
        guard: isIn("open"),
      },
    },
    states: {
      open: {},
      closed: {},
    },
  })
  ```

- Export the following type utilities:

  - `StateFrom`: To infer the state information from any machine
  - `ContextFrom`: To infer the context information from any machine
  - `EventFrom`: To infer the event types from any machine

### Rating `0.1.6`

- Add `data-readonly` to `itemProps`
