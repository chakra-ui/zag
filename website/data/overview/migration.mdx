# Migration Guide

After years of refinement and iteration, we've cemented Zag to work seamlessly
across major JavaScript frameworks.

Now, we're taking things to the next level by focusing on:

- **Performance**: Improving the runtime and rendering performance of every
  component
- **Bundle Size**: Reducing the gross bundle size of each component + framework
  adapters

We achieved this by **moving from an external store to native reactive
primitives** provided by each framework.

Our rigorous performance testing, which involved stress-testing with 10,000
instances of the same component, revealed roughly **1.5x - 4x** performance
improvements across components. [View Breakdown](#performance)

## Changed

The major changes are quite simple, and are listed below:

### useMachine

`useMachine` now returns a `service` object instead of a tuple of
`[state, send]`.

This change is the same across all components. Using "find and replace" will
help you migrate faster.

**Before**

```tsx
const [state, send] = useMachine(avatar.machine({ id: useId() }))
```

**After**

```tsx
const service = useMachine(avatar.machine, { id: useId() })
```

> Notice that `avatar.machine` is no longer a function, it is passed directly to
> `useMachine`.

### Controlled vs Uncontrolled value

Managing controlled and uncontrolled values is a fairly common need in most
component libraries.

Previously, we handled this by providing initial and controlled context to the
machine.

```tsx
///                                                    üëáüèª Default value
const [state, send] = useMachine(numberInput.machine({ value: "10" }), {
  context: {
    // üëáüèª Controlled value
    value: "10",
  },
})
```

This can be initially confusing to users and is error prone.

Now, we've moved the logic to the machine itself. Allowing users to explicitly
provide a default value and a controlled value.

```tsx
const service = useMachine(numberInput.machine, {
  // üëáüèª Default value
  defaultValue: "10",
  // üëáüèª Controlled value
  value: "10",
})
```

> This change applies all component with some form of `value` prop.

### Controlled vs Uncontrolled open

Previously, we handled controlled and uncontrolled open states by providing
initial `open` state and an additional `open.controlled` property.

```tsx
//                                                    üëáüèª Default value
const [state, send] = useMachine(dialog.machine({ open: true }), {
  context: {
    // üëáüèª Controlled value
    open: true,
    "open.controlled": true,
  },
})
```

Now, we've moved the logic to the machine itself. Allowing users to explicitly
provide a default and controlled open state.

```tsx
const service = useMachine(dialog.machine, {
  // üëáüèª Default value
  defaultOpen: true,
  // üëáüèª Controlled value
  open: true,
})
```

### Typings

`<component>.Context` is now renamed to `<component>.Props`

**Before**

```tsx
import * as accordion from "@zag-js/accordion"

interface Props extends accordion.Context {}
```

**After**

```tsx
import * as accordion from "@zag-js/accordion"

interface Props extends accordion.Props {}
```

### Toast

The toast component new requires that you create a toast store (or manager), and
pass that store to the toast group machine.

This store is to be used in userland to create and manage toasts.

> Refer to the [toast](/components/react/toast) documentation for more details.

**Before**

```tsx
const [state, send] = useMachine(
  toast.group.machine({
    overlap: false,
    placement: "bottom",
  }),
)

const toaster = toast.group.connect(state, send, normalizeProps)

// propagate the `toaster` via context and use it in your app.

toaster.create({
  title: "Hello",
  description: "World",
})
```

**After**

```tsx
const toaster = toast.createStore({
  overlap: false,
  placement: "bottom",
})

const service = useMachine(toast.group.machine, {
  store: toaster,
})

// use the `toaster` store to create and manage toasts. No need for context.

toaster.create({
  title: "Hello",
  description: "World",
})
```

For Solid.js users, we recommend using `<Key>` exported from `@zag-js/solid`
when mapping over the toasts, instead of the `<For>` component.

## Fixed

- **Menu**: Fix issue where context menu doesn't update positioning on
  subsequent right clicks.

- **Avatar**: Fix issue where `api.setSrc` doesn't work.

- **File Upload**: Fix issue where drag-and-drop doesn't work when `directory`
  is `true`.

- **Carousel**

  - Fix issue where initial page is not working.
  - Fix issue where pagination sync broken after using dots indicators.

## Removed

- General

  - Removed `useActor` hook in favor of `useMachine` everywhere.
  - Removed `open.controlled` in favor of `defaultOpen` and `open` props.

- Pagination

  - `api.setCount` is removed in favor of explicitly setting the `count` prop.

- Select, Combobox

  - `api.setCollection` is removed in favor of explicitly setting the
    `collection` prop.

compared the before and after.

## Bundle Size

We've made significant strides in reducing the bundle size of the overall
library. The core package powers all components. It is now less than 2KB
minified, a whopping **98% reduction** in size.

**Before**: 13.78 KB

**After**: 1.52 KB

## Contributors Notes

- `activities` is now renamed to `effects`

- `prop`, `context` and `refs` are now explicitly passed to the machine. Prior
  to this everything was pass to the `context` object which was quite expensive
  (performance wise).

- The syntax for `watch` has changed significantly, refer to the new machines to
  learn how it works. It is somewhat similar to how `useEffect` works in react.

- `createMachine` is just an identity function, it doesn't do anything. The
  machine work is now moved to the framework `useMachine` hook.
