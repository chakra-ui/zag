# What is a state machine?

A state machine is a tool for modeling stateful, reactive systems. It is useful
for declaratively describing the behavior of an application or component.

To model any logic as using the state machine pattern, it must have:

- A finite number of states.
- A finite number of transitions between states.

## Example of state machine

Consider a simple toggle or switch component that consists of two states,
`active` and `inactive`. The initial state will be `active`

The supported transitions that can happen here:

- In the `active` state, when we click the toggle, it should transition to the
  `inactive` state
- In the `inactive` state, when we click the toggle, it should transition to the
  `active` state

Here's how we'll model the logic in code:

```jsx
import { createMachine } from "@zag-js/core"

const machine = createMachine({
  // initial state
  initial: "active",
  // the finite states
  states: {
    active: {
      on: {
        CLICK: {
          // go to inactive
          target: "inactive",
        },
      },
    },
    inactive: {
      on: {
        CLICK: {
          // go to active
          target: "active",
        },
      },
    },
  },
})
```

The `machine` gives you access to these key information:

- `state`: State is a representation of the machine at a specific point in time
  and contains the following properties:

  - `value`: the current state value
  - `context`: the current context or data stored in the machine
  - `event`: the event object that triggered the transition of this current
    state
  - `matches(...)`: the function to check whether the machine is in a specific
    state. It's similar to `state.value === <state>`

- `send`: A function to send events or signals to the machine.

Now that we've modelled the component logic, let's map that to DOM attributes
and event handlers following the
[WAI-ARIA](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-practices-1.1/examples/checkbox/checkbox-1/checkbox-1.html)
specification for the switch component.

We'll write a function called `connect` to do this.

```jsx
function connect(state, send) {
  const active = state.matches("active")
  return {
    active,
    buttonProps: {
      type: "button",
      role: "switch",
      "aria-checked": active,
      onClick() {
        send("CLICK")
      },
    },
  }
}
```

Here's how to consume the toggle machine logic and connect in React.js.

```jsx
import { useMachine } from "@zag-js/react"
import { machine, connect } from "./toggle"

function Toggle() {
  const [state, send] = useMachine(machine)
  const api = connect(state, send)

  return (
    <button
      {...api.buttonProps}
      style={{
        width: "40px",
        height: "24px",
        borderRadius: "999px",
        background: api.active ? "green" : "gray",
      }}
    >
      {api.active ? "ON" : "OFF"}
    </button>
  )
}
```

That's it! Now you've learned the fundamentals of a component state machine.
