# Programmatic Control

In some cases, you may want to control the state or context values of a machine
programmatically via its `props` or based on certain conditions. This is
typically known as "controlling" the components.

Zag provides a number of ways to control the state of a machine
programmatically.

## Setting initial context

All machines have an "internal" context value that is used to manage extended
state (or data) within the machine. To extend the initial value of this context,
we allow users pass it directly into the `machine` function.

> This is used to set/override the **initial** context value of the machine. It
> can't be updated later on. Keep reading to see how to update it.

For example, if you want an accordion to start with a specific selected value.
Here's how to acheive that:

```jsx
const [state, send] = useMachine(
  // set initial context value
  accordion.machine({
    value: "item-1",
  }),
)
```

## Transient updates

You can pass the context value to the `useMachine` hook directly.

```jsx
const [state, send] = useMachine(accordion.machine, {
  context: {
    value: props.value,
  },
})
```

## Using exposed methods

The `connect` method of the machines provide helpful methods (APIs) to change
the machine state or update its context.

> machine.

Let's say we'd like to change the expanded accordion item in an accordion group.
Here's how to do that:

```jsx
function Accordion() {
  // 1. Bind the machine in your framework
  const [state, send] = useMachine(accordion.machine)

  // 2. Call the connect function
  const api = accordion.connect(state, send)

  // 3. Use exposed methods
  api.setValue("item-1")

  return (...)
}
```

Now, let's say you'd like to update the selected accordion based on props passed
to the `Accordion` component, here is how to do that in React:

```jsx
import useUpdateEffect from "use-update-effect"

function Accordion(props) {
  const [state, send] = useMachine(
    accordion.machine({
      value: props.value,
    }),
  )

  const api = accordion.connect(state, send)

  useUpdateEffect(() => {
    api.setValue(props.value)
  }, [props.value])

  return (...)
}
```

## Controlled Usage in React

When using framework like React, you might want to fully control the value
passed to a machine, and react to changes to that value (via a change handler).

There are some key things to note:

- Zag is "react" agnostic and doesn't follow the classic controlled "read-only"
  behavior in React. We assume uncontrolled by default and re-sync the DOM as
  needed.

- Zag works like native DOM, you can set and get an element's value, but you
  can't force it (except if you intercept the input native events and prevent it
  from happening).

To get this working in React, you can use the `flushSync` method from
`react-dom` to ensure the changes are always in sync.

```jsx {2,11-13}
import { useState } from "react"
import { flushSync } from "react-dom"

const NumberInput = () => {
  const [value, setValue] = useState("123")

  const [state, send] = useMachine(machine({ id: "1" }), {
    context: {
      value,
      onValueChange(details) {
        flushSync(() => {
          setValue(details.value)
        })
      },
    },
  })
}
```
