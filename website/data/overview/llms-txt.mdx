# LLMs.txt

## What is LLMs.txt?

We support [LLMs.txt](https://llmstxt.org/) files for making the Zag JS
documentation available to large language models (LLMs). This feature helps AI
tools better understand our component library, its APIs, and usage patterns.

## Available Routes

We provide several LLMs.txt routes to help AI tools access our documentation:

- <LLMsTxtLink href="/llms.txt" /> - Contains a structured overview of all
  components and their documentation links
- <LLMsTxtLink href="/llms-full.txt" /> - Provides comprehensive documentation
  including implementation details and examples
- <LLMsTxtLink href="/llms-react.txt" /> - React-specific documentation and
  implementation details
- <LLMsTxtLink href="/llms-solid.txt" /> - SolidJS-specific documentation and
  implementation details
- <LLMsTxtLink href="/llms-vue.txt" /> - Vue-specific documentation and
  implementation details
- <LLMsTxtLink href="/llms-svelte.txt" /> - Svelte-specific documentation and
  implementation details

## Usage with AI Tools

### Cursor

Use the `@Docs` feature in Cursor to include the LLMs.txt files in your project.
This helps Cursor provide more accurate code suggestions and documentation for
Zag JS components.

### Windstatic

Reference the LLMs.txt files using `@` or in your `.windsurfrules` files to
enhance Windstatic's understanding of Zag JS components.

### Other AI Tools

Any AI tool that supports LLMs.txt can use these routes to better understand Zag
JS. Simply point your tool to any of the routes above based on your framework of
choice.
