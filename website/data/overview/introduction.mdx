# Introduction to Zag

Zag is a framework agnostic toolkit for implementing complex, interactive, and
accessible UI components in your design system and web applications.

> Zag is part of the next evolution of Chakra UI, and one of the four arms of
> the future of Chakra UI.

With Zag, you can build accessible UI components in React, Solid and Vue without
sweating over the logic.

## Motivation

In [Chakra UI React](https://chakra-ui.com/), we've experienced too many hiccups
and bugs in the past related to how we coordinate events, manage state, and side
effects. Most these bugs are associated with the orchestration within
`useEffect`, `useMemo`, `useCallback`, etc.

These issues were replicated in our [Chakra UI Vue](https://vue.chakra-ui.com/)
pursuit as well, and created a maintenance hell for us. We're grateful for this
experience because it made us take a step back to define how we would like to
build components in the future.

We believe that most widgets should function the same way regardless of the
framework they're built with. That's why we built Zag.

> Don't re-invent the wheel, **let the machines do the work üòä**

## Why Zag?

- **Powered by state machines üå≥**: Zag is built on top of the latest ideas in
  Statecharts. We don't follow the SCXML specifications, but we've created an
  API that we think will help us build more complex components fast.

- **Write once, use everywhere ü¶Ñ**: The component interactions are modelled in
  a framework agnostic way. We provide adapters for JS frameworks so you can use
  it in React, Solid, or Vue 3.

- **Focus on accessibility ‚ôøÔ∏è**: Zag is built with accessibility in mind. We
  handle many details related to keyboard interactions, focus management, aria
  roles and attributes.

- **Headless ‚ú®**: The machine APIs are completely unstyled and gives you the
  control to use any styling solution you prefer.

- **Incremental adoption ‚ú®**: Adopt the machines as you need them. Each
  component machine is an NPM package and can be installed individually so you
  can use them incrementally.

## Fun Facts

**Zag** means to _take a sharp change in direction_. This clearly describes our
approach of using state machines to power the logic behind UI components.

### Teasers

- When you see someone using classic react, vue or solid to build an interactive
  UI component that exists in Zag, tell them to **"zag it!"** ‚ö°Ô∏è

- Anyone using Zag will be called a **"zagger"** üí•

- The feeling you get when you use Zag will be called **"zagadat!"** üöÄ

- The Zag community will be called **"zag nation"** üî•

## Additional Thanks

- [Guillermo](https://rauchg.com/2015/pure-ui) for writing a great article that
  sparked the idea for Zag.
- [Open UI](https://open-ui.org/) for inspiring the pattern behind this library
- [XState](https://xstate.js.org/) for inspiring the base implementation of the
  state machine

  patterns in the machine (`computed` and `watch`)
- [David Khourshid](https://twitter.com/DavidKPiano) for talking about state
  machines long enough to get me started on this project
