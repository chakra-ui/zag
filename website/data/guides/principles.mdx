# Principles

## Getting element references

Due to the framework-agnostic approach of the machine, it's recommended to use
vanilla JS approach to grabbing element references instead of framework-specific
tools like `ref`, `useRef`, etc.

Prefer using `getElementById`, `querySelector`, `querySelectorAll`, etc. Ensure
you're using the correct owner document to make them work within iframes and
custom window environments like `Electron.js`

## Measuring geometry (point, rect, size, etc)

Geometry and measurement is a core aspect of designing UI components logic. We
provide a lot of utilities to help to achieve this. See the `package/utilities`
packages, it provides utilities like `getEventPoint`, `getElementRect`,
`alignRects`, etc.

## Storing large objects in context

We use the `valtio` library under the hood. Based on its design, it doesn't
track large objects like DOM elements (`window` or `document`) and even machine
instances (aka services).

You'll notice that it'll throw an `Illegal Invocation Error` when assigning
large objects to context. To fix this, you'll need to wrap them in a `ref`
function exported by `valtio`

```jsx
ctx.doc = document // ❌ Illegal Invocation Error

import { ref } from "@zag-js/core"
ctx.doc = ref(document) // ✅ Works
```

## Use pointer events

The Pointer event API is supported is most browsers by default
[(See support)](https://caniuse.com/pointer). When checking for pointer down,
consider using `onPointerDown` instead of `onMouseDown` or `onTouchStart` except
you're designing for a specific pointer type.

## Naming states

State name should active and not passive. It should represents something
happening, e.g. `searching`, `scrubbing` or an identifiable situation, e.g.
`focused`, `visited`, `logged-in`
