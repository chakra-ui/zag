# Usage with React

There two ways to use UI machines in React:

- Local state usage with `useMachine` (recommended)
- Global Context usage (library maintainers)

## Local state

This is useful the component encapsulate the state and doesn't use react
context. You can use the `useMachine` hook from `@zag-js/react`.

```jsx
import { useMachine } from "@zag-js/react"
import * as Toggle from "@zag-js/toggle"

function Toggle() {
  const [state, send] = useMachine(Toggle.machine)
  const { isActive, triggerProps } = Toggle.connect(state, send)
  return <button {...triggerProps}>{isActive ? "On" : "Off"}</button>
}
```

## Global state

When you need to build compound components or propagate the machine's state via
React context, we recommended using the `useService` and `useActor` hooks to get
better rendering optimization and performance.

This technique can be useful if you're building a design system or UI library on
top of UI machines.

> This feature is powered by the `useSnapshot` hook provided by `valtio`

Let's take an example of an accordion component using the compound component
pattern. It'll have:

- `Accordion`: holds the machine and provides it via context
- `AccordionItem`: consumes the accordion context and renders a single accordion
  item

```jsx
import { createContext, useContext } from "react"
import { useService, useActor } from "@zag-js/react"
import * as TAccordion from "@zag-js/react"

// For TypeScript users, the type signature of this will be `TAccordion.Machine`
const AccordionContext = createContext({})

function Accordion({ children }) {
  const service = useService(TAccordion.machine)
  return (
    <AccordionContext.Provider value={service}>
      <div className="accordion">{children}</div>
    </AccordionContext.Provider>
  )
}

function AccordionItem({ value }) {
  const service = useContext(AccordionContext)
  const [state, send] = useActor(service)

  const { getTriggerProps, getPanelProps } = TAccordion.connect(state, send)

  return (
    <div className="accordion--item">
      <button {...getTriggerProps({ value })}>Trigger</button>
      <div {...getPanelProps({ value })}>Panel content</div>
    </div>
  )
}
```

### Some Gotchas

Since the base library we use is `valtio`, there some best practices you need to
follow:

- Avoid destructuring. `valtio` uses the `Proxy` API that tracks property access
  via the dot notation (for nested properties)

```jsx
const [state, send] = useMachine(machine)

// ❌ Don't do this
const { value } = state.context

// ✅ Do this instead
const value = state.context.value
```

- When dealing with editable fields, you might notice inconsistent caret
  behavior. This is due to the state batching mechanism in valtio. To fix this
  pass the `hookSync` option to machine.

```jsx
const machine = createMachine({...}, { hookSync: true })
```
