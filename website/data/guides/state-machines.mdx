# State Machines

A state machine is a model used to design the logic of a UI component. It
consists of:

- a finite number of states
- an initial state
- a number of transitions from one state to another
- an extended data that can be modified as the machine moves from one state to
  another

## State Machine Config

- `id`: the unique `id` of the machine
- `context`: an extended data that can be modified as the machine moves from one
  state to another
- `computed`: properties that re-evaluate when context value is changed. Their
  values are also stored in context and readonly.
- `states`: a finite number of states with define state configuration
- `initial`: the initial state the machine should start in
- `entry`: actions to run when the machine starts
- `exit`: actions to run when the machine stops
- `activities`: long-running activities to run when the machine starts
- `watch`: a more generic way to react to context changes
- `on`: an object that defines a list of global events the machine can respond
  to regardless of the state is it in. These are helpful when you need to
  provide external functions that change state or modifies the context.

### State Node Configuration

In a given state, here are the list of properties you can use:

- `on`: This is used to describe the events that the machine can respond to, and
  the instruction to be executed when it receives that event (aka "transition
  config")
- `entry`: The actions or functions to execute when the machine enter the given
  state.
- `exit`: The actions or functions to execute when the machine exits/leaves the
  given state.
- `after`: A timer-based transition that instructs the machine to execute a
  transition config after a given time. It uses `setTimeout` under the hood.
- `every`: A timer-based action that the machine should execute at the specified
  interval. It uses `setInterval` under the hood.
- `tags`: Extra metadata that are used to describe the given state. They can
  useful in grouping different states. For example, assume we have two states
  `loadingUser` and `loadingFriend`, that can both share a `loading` tag.
- `type`: Usually used to mark a state as a final state by setting its value to
  `final`
- `activities`: an actions or functions that are continuous or long-running
  (think `setInterval`, `addEventListener`, `subscribe`) and can be cleaned up.

```jsx
const machine = createMachine({
  // ...
  states: {
    // given this active state
    active: {
      // extra metadata attached to this state
      tags: "on",
      // execute `setValue` function/action every 200 ms
      every: {
        200: ["setValue"],
      },
      // execute `focusMenu` function/action when `active` state is entered
      entry: ["focusMenu"],
      // execute `clearValue` function/action when `active` state is exited
      exit: ["clearValue"],
      // after 1000ms, execute the transition config
      after: {
        1000: {
          // I'll explain this later in this doc but this is the transition config
          target: "inactive",
        },
      },
      // the events that the machine can respond to
      on: {
        CLICK: {
          // I'll explain this later in this doc but this is the transition config
          target: "inactive",
          actions: ["setValue"],
        },
      },
      // execute `addEventListener` when the `active` state is entered
      activities: ["addEventListener"],
    },
  },
})
```

## State Context

The machine's context is used to define any data that the machine can mutate as
it transitions between states or/and execute actions. Its value will be passed
to many event handler functions, such as `actions`, `entry` and `exit`, and may
be mutated by these functions.

```jsx
const counter = createMachine({
  context: { count: 0 },
  on: {
    INC: { actions: (ctx) => ctx.count++ },
  },
})

counter.start()
counter.context.count // 0
counter.send("INC")
counter.context.count // 0
```

### Computed Values

Computed context can be used to calculate and display values based on a value.
It can be useful to manipulate, and display data within your components in a
readable and efficient manner.

```jsx
const counter = createMachine({
  context: { count: 5 },
  computed: {
    text: (ctx) => `${ctx.count} out of 10`,
  },
  // ...
})

counter.context.text // 5 out of 10
```

When using TypeScript, computed property types are defined as `readonly` in the
context type.

```tsx
type Context = {
  count: number
  // this is the computed part
  readonly text: string
}

const counter = createMachine<Context>({
  context: { count: 5 },
  computed: {
    text: (ctx) => `${ctx.count} out of 10`,
  },
  // ...
})
```

## State Transitions

When building a machine with multiple states, you need a way to transition
between states. This is typically called a "state transition". A state
transition typically includes

- `target`: The state the machine should transition to
- `actions`: The actions to execute during the transition
- `guard`: The condition that determines when the transition is allowed.

Transitions are typically used in the `on` key event object and the `after`
time-based transition.

```jsx
const toggle = createMachine({
  context: { count: 0 },
  state: {
    on: {
      CLICK: {
        target: "off",
        actions: (ctx) => ctx.count++,
        guard: (ctx) => ctx.count === 0,
      },
    },
    off: {
      on: {
        CLICK: {
          target: "on",
          actions: (ctx) => ctx.count++,
        },
        // This is the same as { target: "on" }
        FOCUS: "on",
      },
    },
  },
})
```

> Pro Tip: If the transition only includes a `target`, you can simply use a
> string value instead. `on: { CLICK: "off" }`

### Conditions and Guards

When defined transitions, you might to prevent/disallow the transition depending
on a condition. We can this `guards` or `guard` in the state machine.

Consider the transition definition for the `CLICK` event:

```jsx
const counter = createMachine({
  context: { count: 5 },
  computed: {
    isEmpty: (ctx) => ctx.count === 0,
  },
  on: {
    // CLICK event won't work if `ctx.isEmpty` returns true
    CLICK: {
      guard: (ctx) => !ctx.isEmpty,
      target: "on",
      actions: (ctx) => {
        ctx.count++
      },
    },
  },
  // ...
})
```

The defined condition can either be written inline or labelled with a string so
you can provide its implementation later on. Let's see what a labelled version
of the condition looks like.

```jsx
const counter = createMachine(
  {
    context: { count: 5 },
    computed: {
      isEmpty: (ctx) => ctx.count === 0,
    },
    states: {
      active: {
        on: {
          // CLICK event won't work if `ctx.isEmpty` returns true
          CLICK: {
            // 1. here we label the condition or guard
            guard: "isNotEmpty",
            target: "active",
            // yes, actions can be labelled as well
            actions: "increment",
          },
        },
      },
    },
    // ...
  },
  // The second argument of `createMachine` helps you provide the implementation
  {
    guards: {
      // 2. here we provide the implementation
      isNotEmpty: (ctx) => !ctx.isEmpty,
    },
    actions: {
      increment: (ctx) => {
        ctx.count++
      },
    },
  },
)
```

**Logic Branching**

In some cases, you really want to express conditions in the `if-else` manner. To
create a logic branch based on multiple conditions, you can use the array
syntax:

```jsx
const counter = createMachine(
  {
    // ...
    on: {
      // here's the logic branch. When the `CLICK` event is sent:
      CLICK: [
        // take this transition if `isNotEmpty` evaluates to `true`
        { guard: "isNotEmpty", target: "active", actions: "increment" },
        // else, take this transition
        { target: "inactive", actions: "increment" },
      ],
    },
  },
  // ...
)
```

You can also use this logic branching in `every` and `after` actions as well.

```jsx
const counter = createMachine({
  // ...
  states: {
    inactive: {
      // an example of `every` action
      every: [
        // do `increment` every 500ms if `isNotEmpty` is `true`
        { delay: 500, actions: ["increment"], guard: "isNotEmpty" },
        // else do `increment` every 200ms
        { delay: 200, actions: ["increment"] },
      ],
    },
    active: {
      // an example of `after` transition. You get the idea?
      after: [
        {
          target: "active",
          guard: "isNotEmpty",
          delay: 1000,
          actions: ["setValue"],
        },
        { target: "inactive", actions: ["setValue"] },
      ],
    },
  },
})
```

**Using guard helpers**

When expressing conditions or guards, you might find the need to combine
multiple conditions in the classic `||`, `!`, or `&&` fashion. To help with
this, you can import `guards` which ships with helpers for `or`, `and` and
`not`.

This helps to remove the need to write verbose logic like `isNotEmpty` or
`isNotEmptyAndIsAtMax`. You can compose the functions together to express
complex conditions declaratively.

```jsx
import { guards } from "@zag-js/core"

const { and, not } = guards

const machine = createMachine(
  {
    context: {
      list: [],
      max: 4,
    },
    on: {
      CLICK_ADD: {
        // condition evaluates to: isListEmpty && !isAtMax
        guard: and("isListEmpty", not("isAtMax")),
      },
    },
  },
  {
    // the implementation of guards
    guards: {
      isListEmpty: (ctx) => ctx.list.length === 0,
      isAtMax: (ctx) => ctx.list.length === max,
    },
  },
)
```

## Actions

### Entry and Exit actions

Transitions that use `entry` and `exit` properties perform an action when the
value for the field is set. These actions are executed by the user who changes
the value of the field.

### Timed transition and actions

**`after` transition:**

Transitions that use the after property perform an action after the specified
time frame.

- conditional after transition
- serializing after timeout durations

**`every` actions**

Actions that are executed at interval upon state entry

- conditional every action
- serializing every timeout durations

## Activities

- define activities
- serializing activities

## Usage with TypeScript

- defining machine state and context
- defining machine events

## (Advanced) Parent - Child Relationship

- spawning child machines via `spawn`
- sending events to parent via `sendParent`
- sending events to child via `sendChild`
