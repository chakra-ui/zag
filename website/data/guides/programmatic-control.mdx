# Programmatic Control

In some cases, you may want to control the state or context values of a machine
programmatically via its `props` or based on certain conditions. This is
typically known as "controlling" the components.

Zag provides a number of ways to control the state of a machine
programmatically.

## Setting initial context

All machines support setting the controlled and uncontrolled values for context
properties. For example:

- `defaultOpen` and `open` for controlling the open state of disclosure
  components
- `defaultValue` and `value` for controlling the value of input machines

For example, if you want an accordion to start with a specific selected value.
Here's how to achieve that:

```tsx
const service = useMachine(accordion.machine, {
  defaultValue: ["item-1"],
})
```

## Controlled Usage

You can pass the context value to the `useMachine` hook directly and provide the
`onValueChange` callback to react to the changes.

```jsx
const service = useMachine(accordion.machine, {
  value: props.value,
  onValueChange(details) {
    console.log(details)
  },
})
```

## Using exposed methods

The `connect` method of the machines provide helpful methods (APIs) to change
the machine state or update its context.

Let's say we'd like to change the expanded accordion item in an accordion group.
Here's how to do that:

```jsx
function Accordion() {
  // 1. Bind the machine in your framework
  const service = useMachine(accordion.machine)

  // 2. Call the connect function
  const api = accordion.connect(service)

  // 3. Use exposed methods
  api.setValue("item-1")

  return (...)
}
```
