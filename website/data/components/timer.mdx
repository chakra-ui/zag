# Timer

A timer to record the time elapsed from zero or since a specified timestamp. It
displays start, stop, and resume buttons, and supports custom time interval and
format.

<Resources pkg="@zag-js/timer" />

<Showcase id="TimerCountdown" />

**Features**

- Countdown from a specified time.
- Use as stopwatch to record the time elapsed.
- Control the timer with start, stop, and resume buttons.
- Set the tick interval for the timer.

## Installation

To use the Timer machine in your project, run the following command in your
command line:

<CodeSnippet id="timer/installation.mdx" />

## Anatomy

To set up the Timer correctly, you'll need to understand its anatomy and how we
name its parts.

> Each part includes a `data-part` attribute to help identify them in the DOM.

<Anatomy id="timer" />

## Usage

First, import the timer package into your project

```jsx
import * as timer from "@zag-js/timer"
```

The Timer package exports these functions:

- `machine` — The state machine logic for the Time Picker widget.
- `connect` — The function that translates the machine's state to JSX attributes
  and event handlers.
- `parse` — The function to parse a date time string or object into a `Time`
  object.

> You'll also need to provide a unique `id` to the `useMachine` hook. This is
> used to ensure that every part has a unique identifier.

Next, import the required hooks and functions for your framework and use the
Time Picker machine in your project 🔥

<CodeSnippet id="timer/usage.mdx" />

## Setting the start value

Set the `startMs` property to the timer machine's context to set the start time
in milliseconds.

```jsx
const [state, send] = useMachine(
  timer.machine({
    startMs: 1000 * 60 * 60, // 1 hour
  }),
)
```

Alternatively, you can also use the `timer.parse` function to convert a date
time string or object into milliseconds

```jsx
const [state, send] = useMachine(
  timer.machine({
    startMs: timer.parse("2021-01-01T12:00:00Z"),
    // startMs: timer.parse({ hours: 12, minutes: 0, seconds: 0 }),
  }),
)
```

## Auto starting the timer

Set the `autoStart` property to `true` in the timer machine's context to start
the timer automatically when the component mounts.

```jsx
const [state, send] = useMachine(
  timer.machine({
    autoStart: true,
  }),
)
```

## Usage as countdown timer

To use the timer as a countdown timer, set the `countdown` property to `true` in
the timer machine's context.

```jsx
const [state, send] = useMachine(
  timer.machine({
    countdown: true,
  }),
)
```

## Setting the target value

To set the target value of the countdown timer, pass the `targetMs` property in
the timer machine's context. The timer stops automatically when the `targetMs`
is reached.

When `targetMs` is set and `countdown=true`, the timer ticks down to zero from
the specified target time.

```jsx
const [state, send] = useMachine(
  timer.machine({
    countdown: true,
    targetMs: 1000 * 60 * 60, // 1 hour
  }),
)
```

When `targetMs` is set and `countdown=false|undefined`, the timer ticks up to
the specified target time.

```jsx
const [state, send] = useMachine(
  timer.machine({
    targetMs: 1000 * 60 * 60, // 1 hour
  }),
)
```

## Setting the tick interval

Set the `interval` property to the timer machine's context to set the tick
interval in milliseconds.

```jsx
const [state, send] = useMachine(
  timer.machine({
    interval: 1000, // 1 second
  }),
)
```

## Listening to tick events

When the timer ticks, the `onTick` callback is invoke. You can listen to this
event and update your UI accordingly.

```jsx
const [state, send] = useMachine(
  timer.machine({
    onTick(details) {
      // details => { value, segments }
      console.log(details)
    },
  }),
)
```

## Starting and Stopping the timer

To start the timer, send the `api.start()` callback

```jsx
api.start()
```

To stop the timer, send the `api.stop()` callback

```jsx
api.stop()
```

## Pausing and Resuming the timer

To pause the timer, send the `api.pause()` callback

```jsx
api.pause()
```

To resume the timer, send the `api.resume()` callback

```jsx
api.resume()
```
