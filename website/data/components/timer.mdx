# Timer

The timer machine is used to record the time elapsed from zero or since a
specified target time.

<Resources pkg="@zag-js/timer" />

<Showcase id="TimerCountdown" />

**Features**

- Countdown from a specified time
- Use as stopwatch to record the time elapsed
- Control the timer with start, stop, and resume buttons
- Set the tick interval for the timer

## Installation

To use the Timer machine in your project, run the following command in your
command line:

<CodeSnippet id="timer/installation.mdx" />

## Anatomy

To set up the Timer correctly, you'll need to understand its anatomy and how we
name its parts.

> Each part includes a `data-part` attribute to help identify them in the DOM.

<Anatomy id="timer" />

## Usage

First, import the timer package into your project

```jsx
import * as timer from "@zag-js/timer"
```

The Timer package exports these functions:

- `machine` â€” The state machine logic for the Time Picker widget.
- `connect` â€” The function that translates the machine's state to JSX attributes
  and event handlers.
- `parse` â€” The function to parse a date time string or object into a `Time`
  object.

> You'll also need to provide a unique `id` to the `useMachine` hook. This is
> used to ensure that every part has a unique identifier.

Next, import the required hooks and functions for your framework and use the
Time Picker machine in your project ðŸ”¥

<CodeSnippet id="timer/usage.mdx" />

### Setting the start value

Set the `startMs` property to the timer machine's context to set the start time
in milliseconds.

```jsx
const service = useMachine(timer.machine, {
  startMs: 1000 * 60 * 60, // 1 hour
})
```

Alternatively, you can also use the `timer.parse` function to convert a date
time string or object into milliseconds

```jsx
const service = useMachine(timer.machine, {
  startMs: timer.parse("2021-01-01T12:00:00Z"),
  // startMs: timer.parse({ hours: 12, minutes: 0, seconds: 0 }),
})
```

### Auto starting the timer

Set the `autoStart` property to `true` in the timer machine's context to start
the timer automatically when the component mounts.

```jsx
const service = useMachine(timer.machine, {
  autoStart: true,
})
```

### Usage as countdown timer

To use the timer as a countdown timer, set the `countdown` property to `true` in
the timer machine's context.

```jsx
const service = useMachine(timer.machine, {
  countdown: true,
})
```

### Setting the target value

To set the target value of the countdown timer, pass the `targetMs` property in
the timer machine's context. The timer stops automatically when the `targetMs`
is reached.

When `targetMs` is set and `countdown=true`, the timer ticks down to zero from
the specified target time.

```jsx
const service = useMachine(timer.machine, {
  countdown: true,
  targetMs: 1000 * 60 * 60, // 1 hour
})
```

When `targetMs` is set and `countdown=false|undefined`, the timer ticks up to
the specified target time.

```jsx
const service = useMachine(timer.machine, {
  targetMs: 1000 * 60 * 60, // 1 hour
})
```

### Setting the tick interval

Set the `interval` property to the timer machine's context to set the tick
interval in milliseconds.

```jsx
const service = useMachine(timer.machine, {
  interval: 1000, // 1 second
})
```

### Listening to tick events

When the timer ticks, the `onTick` callback is invoke. You can listen to this
event and update your UI accordingly.

```jsx
const service = useMachine(timer.machine, {
  onTick(details) {
    // details => { value, segments }
    console.log(details)
  },
})
```

### Listening for completion events

When the timer reaches the target time, the `onComplete` callback is invoked.

```jsx
const service = useMachine(timer.machine, {
  countdown: true,
  targetMs: 1000 * 60 * 60, // 1 hour
  onComplete() {
    console.log("Timer completed")
  },
})
```

### Starting and Stopping the timer

To start the timer, send the `api.start()` callback

```jsx
api.start()
```

To stop the timer, send the `api.stop()` callback

```jsx
api.stop()
```

### Pausing and Resuming the timer

To pause the timer, send the `api.pause()` callback

```jsx
api.pause()
```

To resume the timer, send the `api.resume()` callback

```jsx
api.resume()
```
