# Floating Panel

A floating panel is a detachable window that floats above the main interface,
typically used for displaying and editing properties. The panel can be dragged,
resized, and positioned anywhere on the screen for optimal workflow.

> Think of the panel that pops up in Figma when you click `variables` or try set
> a color.

**Features**

- Allows interaction with the main content
- Supports dragging and resizing
- Support for minimizing and maximizing the panel
- Controlled and uncontrolled size and position
- Support for snapping to a grid
- Support for locking the aspect ratio
- Support for closing on escape key
  - Support for persisting the size and position when closed

## Installation

To use the hover card machine in your project, run the following command in your
command line:

<CodeSnippet id="floating-panel/installation.mdx" />

## Anatomy

To set up the editable correctly, you'll need to understand its anatomy and how
we name its parts.

> Each part includes a `data-part` attribute to help identify them in the DOM.

<Anatomy id="floating-panel" />

## Usage

First, import the floating panel package into your project

```jsx
import * as floatingPanel from "@zag-js/floating-panel"
```

The floating panel package exports two key functions:

- `machine` â€” The state machine logic for the floating panel widget.
- `connect` â€” The function that translates the machine's state to JSX attributes
  and event handlers.

Next, import the required hooks and functions for your framework and use the
floating panel machine in your project ðŸ”¥

### Resizing

#### Setting the initial size

To set the initial size of the floating panel, you can pass the `defaultSize`
prop to the machine.

```tsx {2}
const service = useMachine(floatingPanel.machine, {
  defaultSize: { width: 300, height: 300 },
})
```

#### Controlling the size

To control the size of the floating panel programmatically, you can pass the
`size` `onResize` prop to the machine.

```tsx {2}
const service = useMachine(floatingPanel.machine, {
  size: { width: 300, height: 300 },
  onSizeChange(details) {
    // details => { width: number, height: number }
    console.log("floating panel is:", details.width, details.height)
  },
})
```

#### Disable resizing

By default, the panel can be resized by dragging its edges (resize handles). To
disable this behavior, set the `resizable` prop to `false`.

```tsx {2}
const service = useMachine(floatingPanel.machine, {
  resizable: false,
})
```

#### Setting size constraints

You can also control the minimum allowed dimensions of the panel by using the
`minSize` and `maxSize` props.

```tsx {2,3}
const service = useMachine(floatingPanel.machine, {
  minSize: { width: 100, height: 100 },
  maxSize: { width: 500, height: 500 },
})
```

### Aspect ratio

To lock the aspect ratio of the floating panel, set the `lockAspectRatio` prop.
This will ensure the panel maintains a consistent aspect ratio while being
resized.

```tsx {2}
const service = useMachine(floatingPanel.machine, {
  lockAspectRatio: true,
})
```

### Positioning

#### Setting the initial position

To specify the initial position of the floating panel, use the `defaultPosition`
prop. If `defaultPosition` is not provided, the floating panel will be initially
positioned at the center of the viewport.

```tsx {2}
const service = useMachine(floatingPanel.machine, {
  defaultPosition: { x: 500, y: 200 },
})
```

#### Anchor position

An alternative to setting the initial position is to provide a function that
returns the anchor position. This function is called when the panel is opened
and receives the `triggerRect` and `boundaryRect`.

```tsx {2}
const service = useMachine(floatingPanel.machine, {
  getAnchorPosition({ triggerRect, boundaryRect }) {
    return {
      x: boundaryRect.x + (boundaryRect.width - triggerRect.width) / 2,
      y: boundaryRect.y + (boundaryRect.height - triggerRect.height) / 2,
    }
  },
})
```

#### Controlling the position

To control the position of the floating panel programmatically, you can pass the
`position` and `onPositionChange` prop to the machine.

```tsx {2}
const service = useMachine(floatingPanel.machine, {
  position: { x: 500, y: 200 },
  onPositionChange(details) {
    // details => { x: number, y: number }
    console.log("floating panel is:", details.x, details.y)
  },
})
```

#### Disable dragging

The floating panel enables you to set its position and move it by dragging. To
disable this behavior, set the `draggable` prop to `false`.

### Events

The floating panel generates a variety of events that you can handle.

#### Open State

When the floating panel is `opened` or `closed`, the `onOpenChange` callback is
invoked.

```tsx {2-5}
const service = useMachine(floatingPanel.machine, {
  onOpenChange(details) {
    // details => { open: boolean }
    console.log("floating panel is:", details.open ? "opened" : "closed")
  },
})
```

#### Position Change

When the position of the floating panel changes, these callbacks are invoked:

- `onPositionChange` â€” When the position of the floating panel changes.
- `onPositionChangeEnd` â€” When the position of the floating panel changes ends.

```tsx {2-5}
const service = useMachine(floatingPanel.machine, {
  onPositionChange(details) {
    // details => { position: { x: number, y: number } }
    console.log("floating panel is:", details.position.x, details.position.y)
  },
  onPositionChangeEnd(details) {
    // details => { position: { x: number, y: number } }
    console.log("floating panel is:", details.position.x, details.position.y)
  },
})
```

#### Resize

When the size of the floating panel changes, these callbacks are invoked:

- `onResize` â€” When the size of the floating panel changes.
- `onResizeEnd` â€” When the size of the floating panel changes ends.

```tsx {2-5}
const service = useMachine(floatingPanel.machine, {
  onSizeChange(details) {
    // details => { size: { width: number, height: number } }
    console.log("floating panel is:", details.size.width, details.size.height)
  },
  onSizeChangeEnd(details) {
    // details => { size: { width: number, height: number } }
    console.log("floating panel is:", details.size.width, details.size.height)
  },
})
```

#### Minimizing and Maximizing

The floating panel can be minimized, default, and maximized by clicking the
respective buttons in the header. We refer to this as the panel's `stage`.

- When the panel is minimized, the body is hidden and the panel is resized to a
  minimum size.

- When the panel is maximized, the panel scales to the match the size of the
  defined boundary rect (via `getBoundaryEl` prop).

- When the panel is restored, the panel is resized back to the previously known
  size.

When the stage changes, the `onStageChange` callback is invoked.

```tsx {2-5}
const service = useMachine(floatingPanel.machine, {
  onStageChange(details) {
    // details => { stage: "minimized" | "maximized" | "default" }
    console.log("floating panel is:", details.stage)
  },
})
```

## Styling guide

The floating panel component uses data attributes to style its various parts.
Each part has a `data-scope="floating-panel"` and `data-part` attribute that you
can use to target specific elements.

```css
[data-scope="floating-panel"][data-part="content"] {
  /* Add styles for the main panel container */
}

[data-scope="floating-panel"][data-part="body"] {
  /* Add styles for the panel's content area */
}

[data-scope="floating-panel"][data-part="header"] {
  /* Add styles for the panel's header */
}

[data-scope="floating-panel"][data-part="stage-trigger"] {
  /* Add styles for state buttons in the header */
}

[data-scope="floating-panel"][data-part="resize-trigger"] {
  /* Add styles for resize handles */
}

/* North and south resize handles */
[data-scope="floating-panel"][data-part="resize-trigger"][data-axis="n"],
[data-scope="floating-panel"][data-part="resize-trigger"][data-axis="s"] {
  /* Add styles for north and south resize handles */
}

/* East and west resize handles */
[data-scope="floating-panel"][data-part="resize-trigger"][data-axis="e"],
[data-scope="floating-panel"][data-part="resize-trigger"][data-axis="w"] {
  /* Add styles for east and west resize handles */
}

/* Corner resize handles */
[data-scope="floating-panel"][data-part="resize-trigger"][data-axis="ne"],
[data-scope="floating-panel"][data-part="resize-trigger"][data-axis="nw"],
[data-scope="floating-panel"][data-part="resize-trigger"][data-axis="se"],
[data-scope="floating-panel"][data-part="resize-trigger"][data-axis="sw"] {
  /* Add styles for corner resize handles */
}
```

### Dragging

When dragging the panel, the `[data-dragging]` attribute is applied to the
panel.

```css
[data-scope="floating-panel"][data-part="content"][data-dragging] {
  /* Add styles for dragging state */
}
```

### Stacking

The floating panel has several states that can be targeted using data
attributes:

```css
/* When the panel is the topmost element */
[data-scope="floating-panel"][data-part="content"][data-topmost] {
  /* Add styles for topmost state */
}

/* When the panel is behind another panel */
[data-scope="floating-panel"][data-part="content"][data-behind] {
  /* Add styles for behind state */
}
```
