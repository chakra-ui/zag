# Number Input

The number input provides controls for editing, incrementing or decrementing
numeric values using the keyboard or pointer.

<Resources pkg="@zag-js/number-input" />

<Showcase id="NumberInput" />

**Features**

- Based on the spinbutton pattern.
- Supports using the scroll wheel to increment and decrement the value.
- Handles floating point rounding errors when incrementing, decrementing, and
  snapping to step.
- Supports pressing and holding the spin buttons to continuously increment or
  decrement.
- Supports rounding value to specific number of fraction digits.
- Support for scrubbing interaction.

## Installation

To use the number input machine in your project, run the following command in
your command line:

<CodeSnippet id="number-input/installation.mdx" />

This command will install the framework agnostic number input logic and the
reactive utilities for your framework of choice.

## Anatomy

To set up the number input correctly, you'll need to understand its anatomy and
how we name its parts.

> Each part includes a `data-part` attribute to help identify them in the DOM.

<Anatomy id="number-input" />

On a high level, the number input consists of:

- **Root**: The root container for the number input.
- **Input**: The editable field to change the value.
- **Label**: The accessible label for the input.
- **Increment Button**: The spin button to increment the value.
- **Decrement Button**: The spin button to decrement the value.
- **Scrubber**: The element that allows you to change the value by scrubbing.

## Usage

First, import the number input package into your project

```jsx
import * as numberInput from "@zag-js/number-input"
```

The number input package exports two key functions:

- `machine` — The state machine logic for the number input widget as described
  in the WAI-ARIA spinner pattern.
- `connect` — The function that translates the machine's state to JSX attributes
  and event handlers.

> You'll need to provide a unique `id` to the `useMachine` hook. This is used to
> ensure that the every part has a unique identifier.

Next, import the required hooks and functions for your framework and use the
number input machine in your project 🔥

<CodeSnippet id="number-input/usage.mdx" />

## Setting the initial value

To set the initial value of the number input, you can set the `value` context
property.

> **Note:** The value must be a string

```jsx {3}
const [state, send] = useMachine(
  numberInput.machine({
    value: "13",
  }),
)
```

## Setting a minimum and maximum value

Pass the `min` prop or `max` prop to set an upper and lower limit for the input.
By default, the input will restrict the value to stay within the specified
range.

```jsx {3,4}
const [state, send] = useMachine(
  numberInput.machine({
    min: 10,
    max: 200,
  }),
)
```

> To allow the value overflow the specified min or max, set the
> `allowOverflow: true` in the context.

## Adjusting the precision of the value

In some cases, you might need the value to be rounded to specific decimal
points. Pass the `minFractionDigits` to set the minimum number of fractional
digits and `maxFractionDigits` to set the maximum number of fractional digits.

```jsx {3}
const [state, send] = useMachine(
  numberInput.machine({
    minFractionDigits: 2,
  }),
)
```

## Scrubbing the input value

The number input machine supports the scrubber interaction pattern. The use this
pattern, spread the `scrubberProps` from the `api` on to the scrubbing element.

It uses the Pointer lock API and tracks the pointer movement. It also renders a
virtual cursor which mimicks the real cursor's pointer.

<CodeSnippet id="number-input/scrubber.mdx" />

## Using the mousewheel to change value

The number input machine exposes a way to increment/decrement the value using
the mouse wheel event. To activate this, pass the `allowMouseWheel` property to
the machine's context.

```jsx {3}
const [state, send] = useMachine(
  numberInput.machine({
    allowMouseWheel: true,
  }),
)
```

## Clamp value when user blurs the input

In most cases, users can type custom values in the input field. If the typed
value is greater than the max, the value is reset to max when the user blur out
of the input.

To disable this behavior, pass `clampValueOnBlur` and set to `false`.

```jsx {3}
const [state, send] = useMachine(
  numberInput.machine({
    clampValueOnBlur: false,
  }),
)
```

## Listening for value changes

When the value changes, the `onValueChange` callback is invoked.

```jsx {3-8}
const [state, send] = useMachine(
  numberInput.machine({
    onValueChange(details) {
      // details => { value: string, valueAsNumber: number }
      console.log("value is:", details.value)
    },
  }),
)
```

## Usage within forms

To use the number input within forms, set the `name` property in the machine's
context.

```jsx {3}
const [state, send] = useMachine(
  numberInput.machine({
    name: "quantity",
  }),
)
```

## Format and parse value

To apply custom formatting to the input's value, use the exposed `format` and
`parse` functions. For example, to format the input's value to currency, here's
how to achieve it:

```jsx {3,4}
const [state, send] = useMachine(
  numberInput.machine({
    format: (value) => `$${value}`,
    parse: (value) => value.replace(/\$/g, ""),
  }),
)
```

## Styling guide

Earlier, we mentioned that each number-input's part has a `data-part` attribute
added to them to select and style them in the DOM.

### Disabled state

When the number input is disabled, the root, label and input parts will have
`data-disabled` attribute added to them.

The increment and decrement spin buttons are disabled when the number input is
disabled and the min/max is reached.

```css
[data-part="root"][data-disabled] {
  /* disabled styles for the input */
}

[data-part="input"][data-disabled] {
  /* disabled styles for the input */
}

[data-part="label"][data-disabled] {
  /* disabled styles for the label */
}

[data-part="spin-button"][data-disabled] {
  /* disabled styles for the spin buttons */
}
```

### Invalid state

The number input is invalid, either by passing `invalid: true` or when the value
exceeds the max and `allowOverflow: true` is passed. When this happens, the
root, label and input parts will have `data-invalid` attribute added to them.

```css
[data-part="root"][data-invalid] {
  /* disabled styles for the input */
}

[data-part="input"][data-invalid] {
  /* invalid styles for the input */
}

[data-part="label"][data-invalid] {
  /* invalid styles for the label */
}
```

### Readonly state

When the number input is readonly, the input part will have `data-readonly`
added.

```css
[data-part="input"][data-readonly] {
  /* readonly styles for the input */
}
```

### Spin buttons

The spin buttons can be styled individually with their respective `data-part`
attribute.

```css
[data-part="increment-trigger"] {
  /* styles for the increment trigger element */
}

[data-part="decrement-trigger"] {
  /* styles for the decrement trigger element */
}
```

## Methods and Properties

The number-input's `api` exposes the following methods:

<ApiTable name="number-input" />
