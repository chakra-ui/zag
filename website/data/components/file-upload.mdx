# File Upload

File upload component is used to upload multiple files.

The native input file element is quite difficult to style and doesn't provide a
drag-n-drop version.

> The file upload component doesn't handle the actual file uploading process. It
> only handles the UI and the state of the file upload.

<Resources pkg="@zag-js/file-upload" />

<Showcase id="FileUpload" />

**Features**

- Supports a button to open the file dialog.
- Supports drag and drop to upload files.
- Set the maximum number of files that can be uploaded.
- Set the maximum size of the files that can be uploaded.
- Set the accepted file types.

## Installation

To use the file upload machine in your project, run the following command in
your command line:

<CodeSnippet id="file-upload/installation.mdx" />

This command will install the framework agnostic file upload logic and the
reactive utilities for your framework of choice.

## Anatomy

To set up the file upload correctly, you'll need to understand its anatomy and
how we name its parts.

> Each part includes a `data-part` attribute to help identify them in the DOM.

<Anatomy id="file-upload" />

On a high level, the file upload consists of:

- **Root**: The root element of the file upload.
- **Dropzone**: The element that handles the drag and drop functionality.
- **Input**: The visually hidden input element.
- **Trigger**: The element that triggers the file upload.
- **Delete Trigger**: The element that triggers the deletion of a file.

## Usage

First, import the file upload package into your project

```jsx
import * as fileUpload from "@zag-js/file-upload"
```

The file upload package exports two key functions:

- `machine` â€” The state machine logic for the file upload widget.
- `connect` â€” The function that translates the machine's state to JSX attributes
  and event handlers.

Next, import the required hooks and functions for your framework and use the
file uplaod machine in your project ðŸ”¥

<CodeSnippet id="file-upload/usage.mdx" />

## Setting the accepted file types

Use the `accept` attribute to set the accepted file types.

```jsx
const [state, send] = useMachine(
  fileUpload.machine({
    accept: "image/*",
  }),
)
```

## Setting the maximum number of files

Use the `maxFiles` attribute to set the maximum number of files that can be
uploaded. This will set the `multiple` attribute on the underlying input
element.

```jsx
const [state, send] = useMachine(
  fileUpload.machine({
    maxFiles: 5,
  }),
)
```

## Setting the maximum size per file

Use the `maxFileSize` attribute to set the maximum size per file that can be
uploaded.

```jsx
const [state, send] = useMachine(
  fileUpload.machine({
    maxFileSize: 1024 * 1024 * 10, // 10MB
  }),
)
```

## Listening to file changes

When files are uploaded, the `onFilesChange` callback is invoked with the
details of the accepted and rejected files.

```jsx
const [state, send] = useMachine(
  fileUpload.machine({
    onFilesChange: (details) => {
      // details => { acceptedFiles: File[], rejectedFiles: { file: File, errors: [] }[] }
      console.log(details.acceptedFiles)
      console.log(details.rejectedFiles)
    },
  }),
)
```

## Usage within a form

To use the file upload within a form, set the `name` attribute in the machine's
context, and ensure you render the input element `api.hiddenInputProps`

```jsx
const [state, send] = useMachine(
  fileUpload.machine({
    name: "avatar",
  }),
)
```

## Displaying image preview

To display a preview of the uploaded image, use the built-in FileReader API to
read the file and set the `src` attribute of an image element.

```jsx
const [state, send] = useMachine(
  fileUpload.machine({
    onFilesChange: (details) => {
      const reader = new FileReader()
      reader.onload = (event) => {
        const image = event.target.result
        // set the image as the src of an image element
      }
      reader.readAsDataURL(details.acceptedFiles[0])
    },
  }),
)
```

## Disabling drag and drop

To disable the drag and drop functionalty, set the `allowDrop` context property
to `false`.

```jsx
const [state, send] = useMachine(
  fileUpload.machine({
    allowDrop: false,
  }),
)
```

## Styling guide

Earlier, we mentioned that each file upload part has a `data-part` attribute
added to them to select and style them in the DOM.

```css
[data-part="root"] {
  /* styles for root element*/
}

[data-part="dropzone"] {
  /* styles for root element*/
}

[data-part="trigger"] {
  /* styles for file picker trigger */
}

[data-part="label"] {
  /* styles for the input's label */
}
```

### Dragging State

When the user drags a file over the file upload, the `data-dragging` attribute
is added to the root element.

```css
[data-part="dropzone"] [data-dragging] {
  /* styles for when the user is dragging a file over the file upload */
}
```

### Disabled State

When the file upload is disabled, the `data-disabled` attribute is added to the
root element.

```css
[data-part="root"] [data-disabled] {
  /* styles for when the file upload is disabled */
}

[data-part="dropzone"] [data-disabled] {
  /* styles for when the file upload is disabled */
}

[data-part="trigger"] [data-disabled] {
  /* styles for when the file upload trigger is disabled */
}

[data-part="label"] [data-disabled] {
  /* styles for when the file upload label is disabled */
}
```

## Methods and Properties

The file upload's `api` method exposes the following methods:

<ApiTable name="file-upload" />
