# Bottom Sheet

Bottom Sheet is fixed at the bottom of the screen and used to provide content or
additional description and icons related to the current page. In addition, it
can be used to provide significant feedback to a specific user action or get
user confirmation. Users can focus on a description, option, or confirmation
through the bottom sheet.
