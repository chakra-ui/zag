# Time Picker

The time picker is used to time picker a time value, independently from a date
value.

This component builds on top of the native `<input type=time>` experience and
provides a more customizable and consistent user experience.

<Resources pkg="@zag-js/time-picker" />

<Showcase id="TimePicker" />

**Features**

- Select a time value in the menu...
- ...or type it in the input.
- Use seconds for more precision.
- Use different steps for each unit.
- Set a minimum and maximum value.
- Clear button to reset the value.
- Navigate in the menu with keyboard.
- Support for different time formats.

## Installation

To use the Time Picker machine in your project, run the following command in
your command line:

<CodeSnippet id="time-picker/installation.mdx" />

## Anatomy

To set up the Time Picker correctly, you'll need to understand its anatomy and
how we name its parts.

> Each part includes a `data-part` attribute to help identify them in the DOM.

<Anatomy id="time-picker" />

## Usage

First, import the time picker package into your project

```jsx
import * as timePicker from "@zag-js/time-picker"
```

The Time Picker package exports two key functions:

- `machine` â€” The state machine logic for the Time Picker widget.
- `connect` â€” The function that translates the machine's state to JSX attributes
  and event handlers.

> You'll also need to provide a unique `id` to the `useMachine` hook. This is
> used to ensure that every part has a unique identifier.

Next, import the required hooks and functions for your framework and use the
Time Picker machine in your project ðŸ”¥

<CodeSnippet id="time-picker/usage.mdx" />

## Setting the initial value

To set the initial value of the time picker, pass the `value` property to the
time picker machine's context.

> The `value` property must be an instance of `Time` exported from
> `@internationalized/date`, or undefined.

```jsx {4}
const [state, send] = useMachine(
  timePicker.machine({
    id: useId(),
    value: new Time(12, 30),
  }),
)
```

## Disabling the time picker

To disable the time picker, set the `disabled` property in the machine's context
to `true`.

```jsx {4}
const [state, send] = useMachine(
  timePicker.machine({
    id: useId(),
    disabled: true,
  }),
)
```

## Usage with seconds

By default, the time picker only shows the hour and minute cells. To show the
second cell, set the `showSeconds` property in the machine's context to `true`.

```jsx {4}
const [state, send] = useMachine(
  timePicker.machine({
    id: useId(),
    withSeconds: true,
  }),
)
```

## Setting the locale

To set the locale of the time picker, pass the `locale` property to the time
picker machine's context.

> This will affect the presence of the period cell and the time format.

```jsx {4}
const [state, send] = useMachine(
  timePicker.machine({
    id: useId(),
    locale: "fr-FR",
  }),
)
```

## Setting steps

To set the steps for the time picker, pass the `steps` property to the time
picker machine's context.

> The `steps` property must be an object with the following properties:
>
> - `hour` â€” The step for the hour cell.
> - `minute` â€” The step for the minute cell.
> - `second` â€” The step for the second cell.

```jsx {4-8}
const [state, send] = useMachine(
  timePicker.machine({
    id: useId(),
    steps: {
      hour: 2,
      minute: 15,
      second: 30,
    },
  }),
)
```

## Setting min and max values

To set the minimum and maximum values for the time picker, pass the `min` and
`max` properties to the time picker machine's context.

> The `min` and `max` properties must be an instance of `Time` exported from
> `@internationalized/date`.

```jsx {4-5}
const [state, send] = useMachine(
  timePicker.machine({
    id: useId(),
    min: new Time(10), // Only allow times after 10:00:00
    max: new Time(18, 30, 20), // Only allow times before 18:30:20
  }),
)
```

## Listening for focus changes

When an item is focused with the keyboard, use the `onFocusChange` to listen for
the change and do something with it.

```jsx {4-7}
const [state, send] = useMachine(
  timePicker.machine({
    id: useId(),
    onFocusChange(details) {
      // details => { focusedCell: { value: number, unit: TimeUnit } }
      console.log(details)
    },
  }),
)
```

## Listening for value changes

When the value changes, use the `onValueChange` property to listen for the
change and do something with it.

```jsx {4-7}
const [state, send] = useMachine(
  timePicker.machine({
    id: useId(),
    onValueChange(details) {
      // details => { value?: Time, valueAsString?: string }
      console.log(details)
    },
  }),
)
```

## Listening for open and close events

When the time picker is opened or closed, the `onOpenChange` callback is called.
You can listen for these events and do something with it.

```jsx {4-7}
const [state, send] = useMachine(
  timePicker.machine({
    id: useId(),
    onOpenChange(details) {
      // details => { open: boolean }
      console.log("time picker opened")
    },
  }),
)
```

## Usage within dialog

When using the time picker within a dialog, you'll need to avoid rendering the
time picker in a `Portal` or `Teleport`. This is because the dialog will trap
focus within it, and the time picker will be rendered outside the dialog.

> Consider designing a `portalled` property in your component to allow you
> decide where to render the time picker in a portal.

## Styling guide

Earlier, we mentioned that each time picker part has a `data-part` attribute
added to them to time picker and style them in the DOM.

### Open and closed state

When the time picker is open, the trigger and content is given a `data-state`
attribute.

```css
[data-part="trigger"][data-state="open|closed"] {
  /* styles for open or closed state */
}

[data-part="content"][data-state="open|closed"] {
  /* styles for open or closed state */
}
```

### Cell state

Items are given a `data-state` attribute, indicating whether they are selected.

```css
[data-part="hour|minute|second|period-cell"][data-selected] {
  /* styles for selected or unselected state */
}
```

### Disabled state

When the time picker is disabled, the trigger and label is given a
`data-disabled` attribute.

```css
[data-part="trigger"][data-disabled] {
  /* styles for disabled time picker state */
}

[data-part="label"][data-disabled] {
  /* styles for disabled label state */
}
```

> Optionally, when an item is disabled, it is given a `data-disabled` attribute.
