# Angle Slider

An angle slider is a circular dial that allows users to select an angle,
typically in degrees, within a 360Â° range. It provides an intuitive way to
control rotations or orientations, offering accessibility features.

<Showcase id="AngleSlider" />

**Features**

- Fully managed keyboard navigation.
- Supports touch or click on track to update value.
- Supports Right-to-Left directionality.

## Installation

To use the angle slider machine in your project, run the following command in your
command line:

<CodeSnippet id="angle-slider/installation.mdx" />

This command will install the framework agnostic angle slider logic and the reactive
utilities for your framework of choice.

## Anatomy

To set up the angle slider correctly, you'll need to understand its anatomy and how we
name its parts.

> Each part includes a `data-part` attribute to help identify them in the DOM.

<Anatomy id="angle-slider" />

## Usage

First, import the angle-slider package into your project

```jsx
import * as angleSlider from "@zag-js/angle-slider"
```

The angle slider package exports two key functions:

- `machine` â€” The state machine logic for the angle slider widget as described in the
  WAI-ARIA spec.
- `connect` â€” The function that translates the machine's state to JSX attributes
  and event handlers.

> You'll need to provide a unique `id` to the `useMachine` hook. This is used to
> ensure that every part has a unique identifier.

Next, import the required hooks and functions for your framework and use the
angle slider machine in your project ðŸ”¥

<CodeSnippet id="angle-slider/usage.mdx" />

## Setting the initial value

```jsx {3}
const [state, send] = useMachine(
  angleSlider.machine({
    value: 45,
  }),
)
```


## Setting the value's granularity

By default, the granularity, is `1`, meaning that the value is always an
integer. You can change the step attribute to control the granularity.

For example, If you need a value between `5` and `10`, accurate to two decimal
places, you should set the value of step to `0.01`:

```jsx {3}
const [state, send] = useMachine(
  angleSlider.machine({
    step: 0.01,
  }),
)
```

## Listening for changes

When the angle slider value changes, the `onValueChange` and `onValueChangeEnd`
callbacks are invoked. You can use this to setup custom behaviors in your app.

```jsx {3-8}
const [state, send] = useMachine(
  angleSlider.machine({
    onValueChange(details) {
      console.log("value is changing to:", details)
    },
    onValueChangeEnd(details) {
      console.log("value has changed to:", details)
    },
  }),
)
```


## Usage within forms

To use angle slider within forms, use the exposed `hiddenInputProps` from the `connect`
function and ensure you pass `name` value to the machine's context. It will
render a hidden input and ensure the value changes get propagated to the form
correctly.

```jsx {3}
const [state, send] = useMachine(
  angleSlider.machine({
    name: "wind-direction",
  }),
)
```

## RTL Support

The angle slider has built-in support for RTL alignment and interaction. In the RTL
mode, operations are performed from right to left, meaning, the left arrow key
will increment and the right arrow key will decrement.

To enable RTL support, pass the `dir: rtl` context property

```jsx {3}
const [state, send] = useMachine(
  angleSlider.machine({
    dir: "rtl",
  }),
)
```

> While we take care of the interactions in RTL mode, you'll have to ensure you
> apply the correct CSS styles to flip the layout.

## Using angle slider marks

To show marks or ticks along the angle slider track, use the exposed
`api.getMarkerProps()` method to position the angle slider marks at desired angles.

<CodeSnippet id="angle-slider/tick-marks.mdx" />

## Styling guide

Earlier, we mentioned that each angle slider part has a `data-part` attribute added to
them to select and style them in the DOM.



### Disabled State

When the angle slider is disabled, the `data-disabled` attribute is added to the root,
label, control, thumb and marker.

```css
[data-part="root"][data-disabled] {
  /* styles for root disabled state */
}

[data-part="label"][data-disabled] {
  /* styles for label disabled state */
}

[data-part="control"][data-disabled] {
  /* styles for control disabled state */
}

[data-part="thumb"][data-disabled] {
  /* styles for thumb disabled state */
}

[data-part="range"][data-disabled] {
  /* styles for thumb disabled state */
}
```

### Invalid State

When the slider is invalid, the `data-invalid` attribute is added to the root,
track, range, label, and thumb parts.

```css
[data-part="root"][data-invalid] {
  /* styles for root invalid state */
}

[data-part="label"][data-invalid] {
  /* styles for label invalid state */
}

[data-part="control"][data-invalid] {
  /* styles for control invalid state */
}

[data-part="valueText"][data-invalid] {
  /* styles for output invalid state */
}

[data-part="thumb"][data-invalid] {
  /* styles for thumb invalid state */
}

[data-part="marker"][data-invalid] {
  /* styles for marker invalid state */
}
```

### Styling the markers

```css
[data-part="marker"][data-state="(at|under|over)-value"] {
  /* styles for when the value exceeds the marker's value */
}
```
