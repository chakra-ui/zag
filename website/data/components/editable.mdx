# Editable

Editable is an input field used for editing a single line of text. It renders as
static text and transforms into a text input field when then edit interaction is
triggered (click, focus, or double-click).

<Resources pkg="@zag-js/editable" />

<Showcase id="Editable" />

**Features**

- Use custom controls for the editable.
- Pressing `Enter` commits the input value.
- Pressing `Esc` reverts the value.
- Activate edit mode by double-clicking or focusing on the preview text.
- Auto-resize input to fit content

## Installation

To use the editable machine in your project, run the following command in your
command line:

<CodeSnippet id="editable/installation.mdx" />

This command will install the framework agnostic editable logic and the reactive
utilities for your framework of choice.

## Anatomy

To set up the editable correctly, you'll need to understand its anatomy and how
we name its parts.

> Each part includes a `data-part` attribute to help identify them in the DOM.

<Anatomy id="editable" />

On a high level, the editable consists of:

- **Root**: The root container for the editable.
- **Area**: The container that wraps the preview and input.
- **Preview**: The readonly element that displays the value.
- **Input**: The input used to edit the value.

If you're going to use custom controls to trigger edit, save and cancel, you'll
need these parts:

- **Edit Button**: The button to trigger the edit mode.
- **Submit Button**: The button to submit or save the value.
- **Cancel Button**: The button to cancel and revert to previous value.

## Usage

First, import the editable package into your project

```jsx
import * as editable from "@zag-js/editable"
```

The editable package exports two key functions:

- `machine` â€” The state machine logic for the editable widget.
- `connect` â€” The function that translates the machine's state to JSX attributes
  and event handlers.

> You'll need to provide a unique `id` to the `useMachine` hook. This is used to
> ensure that every part has a unique identifier.

Next, import the required hooks and functions for your framework and use the
editable machine in your project ðŸ”¥

<CodeSnippet id="editable/usage.mdx" />

## Using custom controls

In some cases, you might need to use custom controls to toggle the edit and read
mode. We use the render prop pattern to provide access to the internal state of
the component.

<CodeSnippet id="editable/custom-controls.mdx" />

## Auto-resizing the editable

To auto-grow the editable as the content changes, pass the `autoResize: true`
property to the machine's context.

```jsx {3}
const [state, send] = useMachine(
  editable.machine({
    autoResize: true,
  }),
)
```

> **Please note that**, in this mode, the input and preview elements should not
> have any styles. Instead, pass the styles to the "area" element.

### Setting a maxWidth

It is a common pattern to set a maximum of the editable as it auto-grows. To
achieve this, set the `maxWidth` property of the machine's context to the
desired value.

```jsx {3-4}
const [state, send] = useMachine(
  editable.machine({
    autoResize: true,
    maxWidth: "320px",
  }),
)
```

When the editable reaches the specified max-width, it'll clip the preview text
with an ellipsis.

## Editing with double click

The editable supports two modes of activating the "edit" state:

- when the preview part is focused (with pointer or keyboard).
- when the preview part is double-clicked.

To change the mode to "double-click", set the `activationMode: 'dblclick'`
property in the machine's context.

```jsx {3}
const [state, send] = useMachine(
  editable.machine({
    activationMode: "dblclick",
  }),
)
```


## Styling guide

Earlier, we mentioned that each editable part has a `data-part` attribute added
to them to select and style them in the DOM.

### Focused state

When the editable is in the focused mode, we set a `data-focus` attribute on the
"area" part.

```css
[data-part="area"][data-focus] {
  /* CSS for the editable's focus state */
}
```

### Empty state

When the editable's value is empty, we set a `data-empty` attribute on the
"area" part.

```css
[data-part="area"][data-empty] {
  /* CSS for the editable's focus state */
}
```

### Disabled state

When the editable is disabled, we set a `data-disabled` attribute on the "area"
part.

```css
[data-part="area"][data-disabled] {
  /* CSS for the editable's focus state */
}
```
