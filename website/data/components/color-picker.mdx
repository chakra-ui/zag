# Color Picker

The color picker is an input widget used to select a color value from a
predefined list or a color area.

This component builds on top of the native `<input type=color>` experience and
provides a more customizable and consistent user experience.

<Resources pkg="@zag-js/color-picker" />

<Showcase id="ColorPicker" />

**Features**

- Support for custom color area
- Support for RGBA, HSLA, HEX, and HSBA formats
- Support for channel inputs and sliders
- Support for mouse, touch, and keyboard interactions
- Support for form submission and reset events
- Support for named css colors

## Installation

To use the combobox machine in your project, run the following command in your
command line:

<CodeSnippet id="color-picker/installation.mdx" />

This command will install the framework agnostic combobox logic and the reactive
utilities for your framework of choice.

## Anatomy

To set up the combobox correctly, you'll need to understand its anatomy and how
we name its parts.

> Each part includes a `data-part` attribute to help identify them in the DOM.

<Anatomy id="color-picker" />

## Usage

First, import the combobox package into your project

```jsx
import * as colorPicker from "@zag-js/color-picker"
```

The color picker package exports these functions:

- `machine` â€” The state machine logic for the color picker widget.
- `connect` â€” The function that translates the machine's state to JSX attributes
  and event handlers.
- `parse` - The function that parses a color string to an Color object.

Next, import the required hooks and functions for your framework and use the
color picker machine in your project ðŸ”¥

<CodeSnippet id="color-picker/usage.mdx" />

## Setting the initial value

To set the initial value of the color picker, use the `value` context property.

```jsx
const [current, send] = useMachine(
  colorPicker.machine({
    value: colorPicker.parse("#ff0000"),
  }),
)
```

## Listening for change events

When the user selects a color using the color picker, the `onValueChange` and
`onValueChangeEnd` events will be fired.

- `onValueChange` â€” Fires in sync as the user selects a color
- `onValueChangeEnd` â€” Fires when the user stops selecting a color (useful for
  debounced updates)

```jsx
const [current, send] = useMachine(
  colorPicker.machine({
    onValueChange: (details) => {
      // details => { value: Color, valueAsString: string }
    },
    onValueChangeEnd: (details) => {
      // details => { value: Color, valueAsString: string }
    },
  }),
)
```

> When using the `onValueChange` method in React.js, you might need to use the
> `flushSync` method from `react-dom` to ensure the value is updated in sync

## Using a custom color format

By default, the color picker's output format is `rgba`. You can change this
format to either `hsla` or `hsba` by using the `format` context property.

When this property is set, the `value` and `valueAsString` properties of the
`onValueChange` event will be updated to reflect the new format.

```jsx
const [current, send] = useMachine(
  colorPicker.machine({
    format: "hsla",
    onValueChange: (details) => {
      // details => { value: HSLAColor, valueAsString: string }
    },
  }),
)
```

## Showing color presets

Adding color presets in form of swatches can help users pick colors faster. To
support this, use the `getSwatchTriggerProps(...)` and `getSwatchProps(...)` to
get the props needed to show the swatches buttons.

<CodeSnippet id="color-picker/with-swatches.mdx" />

## Disabling the color picker

To disable user interactions with the color picker, set the `disabled` context
property to `true`.

```jsx
const [current, send] = useMachine(
  colorPicker.machine({
    disabled: true,
  }),
)
```

## Controlling the open and closed state

To control the open and closed state of the color picker, use the `open` and
`onOpenChange` context properties.

```jsx
const [current, send] = useMachine(
  colorPicker.machine({
    open: true,
    onOpenChange: (details) => {
      // details => { open: boolean }
    },
  }),
)
```

You can also leverage the `api.open()` or `api.close()` methods to control the
open and closed state of the color picker.

## Controlling individual color channel

In some cases, you may want to allow users to control the values of each color
channel individually. You can do this using an input element or a slider
element, or both.

To support this, use the `getChannelInputProps(...)` to show the channel inputs.

> Note: Make sure you only render the channel inputs that match the `format` of
> the color picker.

<CodeSnippet id="color-picker/with-channel-inputs.mdx" />

## Showing a color preview

To display the value of a color, use the `getSwatchProps(...)` and pass the
color value. To show the current color value, use the `api.value`

<CodeSnippet id="color-picker/with-preview.mdx" />

> You can pass `respectAlpha: false` to show the color value without the alpha
> channel

## Adding an eyedropper

The eye dropper tool is a native browser feature that allows a user pick a color
from a current page's canvas. To support this, use the
`getEyeDropperTriggerProps(...)`.

> **Note:** The eye dropper tool only works in Chrome and Edge browsers

<CodeSnippet id="color-picker/with-eye-dropper.mdx" />

## Usage within forms

To use the color picker within a form, add the `name` context property to the
machine and render the visually hidden input using the `hiddenInputProps`.

```jsx {3}
const [state, send] = useMachine(
  combobox.machine({
    name: "color-preference",
  }),
)
```

## Styling guide

Each color picker part has a `data-part` attribute added to them to help you
identify and style them easily.

### Open and closed state

When the color picker is open or closed, the `data-state` attribute is added to
the trigger, content, control parts.

```css
[data-part="control"][data-state="open|closed"] {
  /* styles for control open or state */
}

[data-part="trigger"][data-state="open|closed"] {
  /* styles for control open or state */
}

[data-part="content"][data-state="open|closed"] {
  /* styles for control open or state */
}
```

### Focused State

When the combobox is focused, the `data-focus` attribute is added to the control
and label parts.

```css
[data-part="control"][data-focus] {
  /* styles for control focus state */
}

[data-part="label"][data-focus] {
  /* styles for label focus state */
}
```

### Disabled State

When the combobox is disabled, the `data-disabled` attribute is added to the
label, control, trigger and option parts.

```css
[data-part="label"][data-disabled] {
  /* styles for label disabled state */
}

[data-part="control"][data-disabled] {
  /* styles for control disabled state */
}

[data-part="trigger"][data-disabled] {
  /* styles for trigger disabled state */
}

[data-part="swatch-trigger"][data-disabled] {
  /* styles for item disabled state */
}
```

### Swatch State

When a swatch's color value matches the color picker's value, the
`data-state=checked` attribute is added to the swatch part.

```css
[data-part="swatch-trigger"][data-state="checked|unchecked"] {
  /* styles for swatch's checked state */
}
```
