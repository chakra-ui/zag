# Splitter

A splitter allow create dynamic layouts split into vertically or horizontally arranged panes. 
Panes are separated by the splitter bars that allow dragging to resize or expand/collapse them.

<Resources pkg="@zag-js/splitter" />

<Showcase id="Splitter" />

**Features**

- Double click a splitter to maximize pane
- Programmatic control of width or height

## Installation

To use the splitter machine in your project, run the following command in your
command line:

<CodeSnippet id="splitter/installation.mdx" />

This command will install the framework agnostic splitter logic and the reactive
utilities for your framework of choice.

## Anatomy

To set up the slider correctly, you'll need to understand its anatomy and how we
name its parts.

> Each part includes a `data-part` attribute to help identify them in the DOM.

<Anatomy id="splitter" />

## Usage

First, import the splitter package into your project

```jsx
import * as splitter from "@zag-js/splitter"
```

The splitter package exports two key functions:

- `machine` — The state machine logic for the splitter widget.
- `connect` — The function that translates the machine's state to JSX attributes
  and event handlers.

> You'll also need to provide a unique `id` to the `useMachine` hook. This is
> used to ensure that every part has a unique identifier.

Next, import the required hooks and functions for your framework and use the
splitter machine in your project 🔥

<CodeSnippet id="splitter/usage.mdx" />

## Listening for events

When the resize trigger of splitter changes, the `onSizeChangeStart` and `onSizeChangeEnd` callback is invoked.

```jsx {9-14}
const [state, send] = useMachine(
  splitter.machine({
    id: useId(),
    size: [
      { id: "aside", size: 40, maxSize: 60 },
      { id: "content", size: 20 },
      { id: "sources" },
    ],
    onSizeChangeStart(detail) {
      console.log("change start", detail)
    },
    onSizeChangeEnd(detail) {
      console.log("change end", detail)
    },
  }),
)
```

## Changing the orientation

By default, the splitter is assumed to be horizontal. To change the orientation to
vertical, set the `orientation` property in the machine's context to `vertical`.

```jsx {9}
const [state, send] = useMachine(
  splitter.machine({
    id: useId(),
    size: [
      { id: "aside", size: 40, maxSize: 60 },
      { id: "content", size: 20 },
      { id: "sources" },
    ],
    orientation: "vertical"
  })
)
```

## Styling guide

Earlier, we mentioned that each accordion part has a `data-part` attribute added
to them to select and style them in the DOM.

### Resize trigger

When an splitter item is horizontal or vertical, a `data-state` attribute is set
on the item and content elements.

```css
[data-scope="splitter"][data-part="resize-trigger"] {
  /* styles for the item */
}

[data-scope="splitter"][data-part="resize-trigger"][data-orientation="horizontal"] {
  /* styles for the item is horizontal state */
}

[data-scope="splitter"][data-part="resize-trigger"][data-orientation="vertical"] {
  /* styles for the item is horizontal state */
}

[data-scope="splitter"][data-part="resize-trigger"][data-focus] {
  /* styles for the item is focus state */
}

[data-scope="splitter"][data-part="resize-trigger"]:active {
  /* styles for the item is active state */
}

[data-scope="splitter"][data-part="resize-trigger"][data-disabled] {
  /* styles for the item is disabled state */
}
```

### Bar

When an splitter item is horizontal or vertical, a `data-state` attribute is set
on the item element.

```css
[data-scope="splitter"][data-part="resize-trigger"] .bar {
  /* styles for the item */
}

[data-scope="splitter"][data-orientation="horizontal"] .bar {
  /* styles for the item is horizontal state */
}

[data-scope="splitter"][data-orientation="vertical"] .bar {
  /* styles for the item is horizontal state */
}
```
