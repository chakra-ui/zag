# Splitter

A splitter allow create dynamic layouts split into vertically or horizontally arranged panes. 
Panes are separated by the splitter bars that allow dragging to resize or expand/collapse them.

<Resources pkg="@zag-js/splitter" />

<Showcase id="Splitter" />

**Features**

- Double click a splitter to maximize pane
- Programmatic control of width or height

## Installation

To use the splitter machine in your project, run the following command in your
command line:

<CodeSnippet id="splitter/installation.mdx" />

This command will install the framework agnostic splitter logic and the reactive
utilities for your framework of choice.

## Anatomy

To set up the slider correctly, you'll need to understand its anatomy and how we
name its parts.

> Each part includes a `data-part` attribute to help identify them in the DOM.

<Anatomy id="splitter" />

## Usage

First, import the splitter package into your project

```jsx
import * as splitter from "@zag-js/splitter"
```

The splitter package exports two key functions:

- `machine` â€” The state machine logic for the splitter widget.
- `connect` â€” The function that translates the machine's state to JSX attributes
  and event handlers.

> You'll also need to provide a unique `id` to the `useMachine` hook. This is
> used to ensure that every part has a unique identifier.

Next, import the required hooks and functions for your framework and use the
rating machine in your project ðŸ”¥

<CodeSnippet id="splitter/usage.mdx" />

## Expand and collapse programmatically

## Listening for events

## Disabling the resizer

## Changing the orientation
