# Toggle Group

A toggle group is used to toggle either one option or multiple options.

<Resources pkg="@zag-js/toggle-group" />

<Showcase id="ToggleGroup" />

**Features**

- Fully managed keyboard navigation.
- Supports horizontal and vertical orientation.
- Support for multiple selection.

## Installation

To use the toggle group machine in your project, run the following command in
your command line:

<CodeSnippet id="toggle-group/installation.mdx" />

This command will install the framework agnostic toggle group logic and the
reactive utilities for your framework of choice.

## Anatomy

To set up the toggle group correctly, you'll need to understand its anatomy and
how we name its parts.

> Each part includes a `data-part` attribute to help identify them in the DOM.

<Anatomy id="toggle-group" />

## Usage

First, import the toggle group package into your project

```jsx
import * as toggle from "@zag-js/toggle-group"
```

The toggle group package exports two key functions:

- `machine` â€” The state machine logic for the toggle group widget as described
  in the WAI-ARIA spec.
- `connect` â€” The function that translates the machine's state to JSX attributes
  and event handlers.

> You'll need to provide a unique `id` to the `useMachine` hook. This is used to
> ensure that every part has a unique identifier.

Next, import the required hooks and functions for your framework and use the
toggle group machine in your project ðŸ”¥

<CodeSnippet id="toggle-group/usage.mdx" />

## Changing the orientation

By default, the toggle group is assumed to be horizontal. To change the
orientation to vertical, set the `orientation` property in the machine's context
to `vertical`.

```jsx {3}
const [state, send] = useMachine(
  toggle.machine({
    orientation: "vertical",
  }),
)
```

## Listening for value changes

When the pressed toggle in the group changes, `onValueChange` callback is
invoked.

```jsx {3-5}
const [state, send] = useMachine(
  toggle.machine({
    onValueChange(details) {
      // details => { value: string[] }
      console.log(details.value)
    },
  }),
)
```

## Allowing multiple selection

Set the `multiple` property in the machine's context to `true` to allow multiple
options to be toggled.

```jsx {3}
const [state, send] = useMachine(
  toggle.machine({
    multiple: true,
  }),
)
```

## Disabling the toggle group

Set the `disabled` property in the machine's context to `true` to disable the
toggle group.

```jsx {3}
const [state, send] = useMachine(
  toggle.machine({
    disabled: true,
  }),
)
```

## Disabling a toggle

Set the `disabled` property in the `getToggleProps` function to `true` to
disable a toggle.

```jsx
//...
<div {...api.getRootProps()}>
  <button {...api.getToggleProps({ value: "bold", disabled: true })}>B</button>
</div>
//...
```

## Disabling focus loop

The toggle group loops keyboard navigation by default. To disable this, set the
`loop` property in the machine's context to `false`.

```jsx {3}
const [state, send] = useMachine(
  toggle.machine({
    loop: false,
  }),
)
```

## Disabling roving focus management

The toggle group uses roving focus management by default. To disable this, set
the `rovingFocus` property in the machine's context to `false`.

```jsx {3}
const [state, send] = useMachine(
  toggle.machine({
    rovingFocus: false,
  }),
)
```

## Styling Guide

Earlier, we mentioned that each toggle group part has a `data-part` attribute
added to them to select and style them in the DOM.

### Pressed State

The toggle is pressed, the `data-state` attribute is applied to the toggle
button with `on` or `off` values.

```css
[data-part="toggle"][data-state="on|off"] {
  /* styles for toggle button */
}
```

### Focused State

When a toggle button is focused, the `data-focus` is applied to the root and
matching toggle button.

```css
[data-part="root"][data-focus] {
  /* styles for the root */
}

[data-part="toggle"][data-focus] {
  /* styles for the toggle */
}
```

### Disabled State

When a toggle button is disabled, the `data-disabled` is applied to the root and
matching toggle button.

```css
[data-part="root"][data-disabled] {
  /* styles for the root */
}

[data-part="toggle"][data-disabled] {
  /* styles for the toggle */
}
```
