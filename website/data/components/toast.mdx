# Toast

The toast component is used to give feedback to users after an action has taken
place.

<Resources pkg="@zag-js/toast" />

<Showcase id="Toast" />

**Features**

- Support for screen readers.
- Limit the number of visible toasts.
- Manage promises within toast.
- Pause on hover, focus or page idle.
- Can remove or update toast programmatically.

## Installation

To use the toast machine in your project, run the following command in your
command line:

<CodeSnippet id="toast/installation.mdx" />

This command will install the framework agnostic toast logic and the reactive
utilities for your framework of choice.

## Anatomy

To set up the toast correctly, you'll need to understand its anatomy and how we
name its parts.

> Each part includes a `data-part` attribute to help identify them in the DOM.

<Anatomy id="toast" />

## Usage

First, import the toast package into your project

```jsx
import * as toast from "@zag-js/toast"
```

Next, import the required hooks and functions for your framework and use the
toast machine in your project ðŸ”¥

<CodeSnippet id="toast/usage.mdx" />

The use the toast effectively, you need to understand these key aspects:

### Toast Group

- `toast.group.machine` â€” The state machine representation of a group of toasts.
  It is responsible for spawning, updating and removing toasts.
- `toast.group.connect` â€” function gives you access to methods you can use to
  add, update, and remove a toast.

  > We recommend setting up the toast group machine once at the root of your
  > project.

### Toast Item

- `toast.machine` â€” The state machine representation of a single toast.
- `toast.connect` â€” The function that takes the toast machine and returns
  methods and JSX properties.

## Creating a toast

There are five toast types that can be created with the toast machine. `info`,
`success`, `loading`, `custom` and `error`.

To create a toast, use the `toast.create(...)` method.

```jsx
toast.create({
  title: "Hello World",
  description: "This is a toast",
  type: "info",
})
```

The options you can pass in are:

- `title` â€” The title of the toast.
- `description` â€” The description of the toast.
- `type` â€” The type of the toast. Can be either `error`, `success` , `info`,
  `loading`, or `custom`.
- `duration` â€” The duration of the toast. The default duration is computed based
  on the specified `type`.
- `onStatusChange` â€” A callback that listens for the status changes across the
  toast lifecycle.
- `placement` â€” The placement of the toast.
- `removeDelay` â€” The delay before unmounting the toast from the DOM. Useful for
  transition.

## Changing the placement

Use the `placement` property when you call the `toast.create(...)` to change the
position of the toast.

```jsx {3}
toast.info({
  title: "Hello World",
  description: "This is a toast",
  placement: "top-start",
})
```

## Overlapping toasts

When multiple toasts are created, they are rendered in a stack. To make the
toasts overlap, set the `overlap` property to `true`.

```jsx
const [state, send] = useMachine(
  toast.group.machine({
    overlap: true,
  }),
)
```

When using overlap, the toast's placement must match the `placement` of the
toast group (which is `bottom` by default).

> Be sure to set up the [required styles](#requirement) to make the toasts
> overlap correctly.

## Changing the duration

Every toast has a default visible duration depending on the `type` set. Here's
the following toast types and matching default durations:

<PropValueTable
  items={{
    headings: ["type", "duration"],
    data: [
      ["info", "5000"],
      ["error", "5000"],
      ["success", "2000"],
      ["loading", "Infinity"],
    ],
  }}
/>

You can override the duration of the toast by passing the `duration` property to
the `toast.create(...)` function.

```jsx {5}
toast.create({
  title: "Hello World",
  description: "This is a toast",
  type: "info",
  duration: 6000,
})
```

> You can also use the `toast.upsert(...)` function which creates or updates a
> toast.

## Using portals

Using a portal is helpful to ensure that the toast is rendered outside the DOM
hierarchy of the parent component. To render the toast in a portal, wrap the
rendered toasts in the `ToastProvider` within your framework-specific portal.

<CodeSnippet id="toast/using-portal.mdx" />

## Programmatic control

To update a toast programmatically, you need access to the unique identifier of
the toast.

This identifier can be either:

- the `id` passed into `toast.create(...)` or,
- the returned random `id` when the `toast.create(...)` is called.

You can use any of the following methods to control a toast:

- `toast.upsert(...)` â€” Creates or updates a toast.
- `toast.update(...)` â€” Updates a toast.
- `toast.remove(...)` â€” Removes a toast instantly without delay.
- `toast.dismiss(...)` â€” Removes a toast with delay.
- `toast.pause(...)` â€” Pauses a toast.
- `toast.resume(...)` â€” Resumes a toast.

```jsx {2,11-15}
// grab the id from the created toast
const id = toast.create({
  title: "Hello World",
  description: "This is a toast",
  type: "info",
  duration: 6000,
  placement: "top-start",
})

// update the toast
toast.update(id, {
  title: "Hello World",
  description: "This is a toast",
  type: "success",
})

// remove the toast
toast.remove(id)

// dismiss the toast
toast.dismiss(id)
```

## Handling promises

The toast group API exposes a `toast.promise()` function to allow you update the
toast when it resolves or rejects.

> With the promise API, you can pass the toast options for each promise
> lifecycle.

```jsx
toast.promise(promise, {
  loading: {
    title: "Loading",
    description: "Please wait...",
  },
  success: (data) => ({
    title: "Success",
    description: "Your request has been completed",
  }),
  error: (err) => ({
    title: "Error",
    description: "An error has occurred",
  }),
})
```

## Pausing the toasts

There are three scenarios we provide to pause a toast from timing out:

- When the document loses focus or the page is idle (e.g. switching to a new
  browser tab), controlled via the `pauseOnPageIdle` context property.
- When the `toast.pause(id)` provided by the `toast.group.connect(...)` is
  called.

```jsx
// Global pause options
const [state, send] = useMachine(
  toast.group.machine({
    pauseOnPageIdle: true,
  }),
)

// Programmatically pause a toast (by `id`)
// `id` is the return value of `api.create(...)`
toast.pause(id)
```

## Limiting the number of toasts

Toasts are great but displaying too many of them can sometimes hamper the user
experience. To limit the number of visible toasts, pass the `max` property to
the group machine's context.

```jsx {3}
const [state, send] = useMachine(
  toast.group.machine({
    max: 10,
  }),
)
```

## Focus Hotkey for toasts

When a toast is created, you can focus the toast region by pressing the
`alt + T`. This is useful for screen readers and keyboard navigation.

Set the `hotkey` context property to change the underlying hotkey.

```jsx
const [state, send] = useMachine(
  toast.group.machine({
    hotkey: ["F6"],
  }),
)
```

## Listening for toast lifecycle

When a toast is created, you can listen for the status changes across its
lifecycle using the `onStatusChange` callback when you call `toast.create(...)`.

The status values are:

- `visible` - The toast is mounted and rendered
- `dismissed` - The toast is visually invisible but still mounted
- `unmounted` - The toast has been completely unmounted and no longer exists

```jsx {3-7}
toast.info({
  title: "Hello World",
  description: "This is a toast",
  type: "info",
  onStatusChange: (details) => {
    // details => { status: "visible" | "dismissed" | "unmounted" }
    console.log("Toast status:", details)
  },
})
```

## Changing the gap between toasts

When multiple toasts are rendered, a gap of `16px` is applied between each
toast. To change this value, set the `gap` context property.

```jsx {3}
const [state, send] = useMachine(
  toast.group.machine({
    gap: 24,
  }),
)
```

## Changing the offset

The toast region has a default `16px` offset from the viewport. Use the `offset`
context property to change the offset.

```jsx {4-8}
const [state, send] = useMachine(
  toast.group.machine({
    offsets: "24px",
  }),
)
```

## Styling guide

### Requirement

The toast machine injects a bunch of css variables that are required for it to
work. You need to connect these variables in your styles.

```css
[data-part="root"] {
  translate: var(--x) var(--y);
  scale: var(--scale);
  z-index: var(--z-index);
  height: var(--height);
  opacity: var(--opacity);
  will-change: translate, opacity, scale;
}
```

To make it transition smoothly, you should includes `transition` properties.

```css
[data-part="root"] {
  transition:
    translate 400ms,
    scale 400ms,
    opacity 400ms;
  transition-timing-function: cubic-bezier(0.21, 1.02, 0.73, 1);
}

[data-part="root"][data-state="closed"] {
  transition:
    translate 400ms,
    scale 400ms,
    opacity 200ms;
  transition-timing-function: cubic-bezier(0.06, 0.71, 0.55, 1);
}
```

### Toast styling

When a toast is created and the `api.getRootProps()` from the `toast.connect` is
used, the toast will have a `data-type` that matches the specified `type` at its
creation.

You can use this property to style the toast.

```css
[data-part="root"][data-type="info"] {
  /* Styles for the specific toast type */
}

[data-part="root"][data-type="error"] {
  /* Styles for the error toast type */
}

[data-part="root"][data-type="success"] {
  /* Styles for the success toast type */
}

[data-part="root"][data-type="loading"] {
  /* Styles for the loading toast type */
}
```
