# Toast

The toast component is used to give feedback to users after an action has taken
place.

<Resources pkg="@zag-js/toast" />

<Showcase id="Toast" />

**Features**

- Support for screen readers.
- Limit the number of visible toasts.
- Manage promises within toast.
- Pause on hover, focus or page idle.
- Can remove or update toast programmatically.
- Support for progress bars.

## Installation

To use the toast machine in your project, run the following command in your
command line:

<CodeSnippet id="toast/installation.mdx" />

This command will install the framework agnostic toast logic and the reactive
utilities for your framework of choice.

## Anatomy

To set up the toast correctly, you'll need to understand its anatomy and how we
name its parts.

> Each part includes a `data-part` attribute to help identify them in the DOM.

<Anatomy id="toast" />

On a high level, the toast consists of:

- **Group**: The element that serves as a container for all the toasts.
- **Root**: The root container for the toast.
- **Title**: The element that contains the title of the toast.
- **Description**: The element that contains the description of the toast.
- **Close Button**: The action button that is used to dimiss a toast.

## Usage

First, import the toast package into your project

```jsx
import * as toast from "@zag-js/toast"
```

Next, import the required hooks and functions for your framework and use the
toast machine in your project ðŸ”¥

<CodeSnippet id="toast/usage.mdx" />

The toast consists of three key aspects:

### Toast Item

- `toast.machine` â€” The state machine representation of a single toast.
- `toast.connect` â€” The function that takes the toast machine and returns
  methods and JSX properties.

### Toast Group

- `toast.group.machine` â€” The state machine representation of a group of toasts.
  It is responsible for spawning, updating and removing toasts.
- `toast.group.connect` â€” function gives you access to methods you can use to
  add, update, and remove a toast.

  > We recommend setting up the toast group machine once at the root of your
  > project.

### External (Experimental)

- `toast.api` â€” The external function that can be used to control toasts from
  outside the framework.

## Creating a toast

There are five toast types that can be created with the toast machine. `info`,
`success`, `loading`, `custom` and `error`.

To create a toast, use the `toast.create(...)` method.

```jsx
toast.create({
  title: "Hello World",
  description: "This is a toast",
  type: "info",
})
```

The options you can pass in are:

- `title` â€” The title of the toast.
- `description` â€” The description of the toast.
- `type` â€” The type of the toast. Can be either `error`, `success` , `info`,
  `loading`, or `custom`.
- `duration` â€” The duration of the toast. The default duration is computed based
  on the specified `type`.
- `onClose` â€” A function that is called when the toast is closed.
- `placement` â€” The placement of the toast.
- `render` â€” A function that returns the toast JSX (Useful for library authors).

> **Important note ðŸš¨**: When a toast is created and its visible duration has
> elapsed , we add `500ms` delay before removing it from the DOM. You can use
> this delay to animate the toast out.

## Setting custom duration

Every toast has a default visible duration depending on the `type` set. Here's
the table showing the toast type and duration.

| type      | duration   |
| --------- | ---------- |
| `info`    | `5000`     |
| `error`   | `5000`     |
| `success` | `2000`     |
| `custom`  | `5000`     |
| `loading` | `Infinity` |

You can override the duration of the toast by passing the `duration` property to
the `toast.create(...)` function.

```jsx {5}
toast.create({
  title: "Hello World",
  description: "This is a toast",
  type: "info",
  duration: 6000,
})
```

> You can also use the `toast.upsert(...)` function which creates or updates a
> toast.

## Using portals

Using a portal is helpful to ensure that the toast is rendered outside the DOM
hierarchy of the parent component. To render the toast in a portal, wrap the
rendered toasts in the `ToastProvider` within your framework-specific portal.

<CodeSnippet id="toast/using-portal.mdx" />

## Positioning toast

To position a toast when created, you can pass the `placement` property when you
call the `toast.create(...)` methods provided by the toast group's connect
funtion.

```jsx {6}
toast.create({
  title: "Hello World",
  description: "This is a toast",
  type: "info",
  duration: 6000,
  placement: "top-start",
})
```

## Programmatic control

To update a toast programmatically, you need access to the unique identifier of
the toast.

This identifier can be either:

- the `id` passed into `toast.create(...)` or,
- the returned random `id` when the `toast.create(...)` is called.

You can use any of the following methods to control a toast:

- `toast.upsert(...)` â€” Creates or updates a toast.
- `toast.update(...)` â€” Updates a toast.
- `toast.remove(...)` â€” Removes a toast instantly without delay.
- `toast.dismiss(...)` â€” Removes a toast with delay.
- `toast.pause(...)` â€” Pauses a toast.
- `toast.resume(...)` â€” Resumes a toast.

```jsx {2,11-15}
// grab the id from the created toast
const id = toast.create({
  title: "Hello World",
  description: "This is a toast",
  type: "info",
  duration: 6000,
  placement: "top-start",
})

// update the toast
toast.update(id, {
  title: "Hello World",
  description: "This is a toast",
  type: "success",
})

// remove the toast
toast.remove(id)

// dismiss the toast
toast.dismiss(id)
```

## Handling promises

The toast group API exposes a `toast.promise()` function to allow you update the
toast when it resolves or rejects.

> With the promise API, you can pass the toast options for each promise
> lifecycle.

```jsx
toast.promise(promise, {
  loading: {
    title: "Loading",
    description: "Please wait...",
  },
  success: (data) => ({
    title: "Success",
    description: "Your request has been completed",
  }),
  error: (err) => ({
    title: "Error",
    description: "An error has occurred",
  }),
})
```

## Using progressbars

The toast machine allows you render a custom progress bar to visualize the time
left before the toast closes.

The `toast.connect` api exposes a `progressbarProps` object you can use for this
purpose.

```jsx {4}
// ...
return (
  <pre {...api.rootProps}>
    <div {...api.progressbarProps} />
    <p {...api.titleProps}>{api.title}</p>
    <p {...api.descriptionProps}>{api.description}</p>
    <button onClick={api.dismiss}>Close</button>
  </pre>
)
```

## Pausing the toasts

There are three scenarios we provide to pause a toast from timing out:

- When the document loses focus or the page is idle (e.g. switching to a new
  browser tab), controlled via the `pauseOnPageIdle` context property.
- When the toast is hovered or focused, controlled by the `pauseOnInteraction`
  context property.
- When the `toast.pause(id)` provided by the `toast.group.connect(...)` is
  called.

```jsx
// Global pause options
const [state, send] = useMachine(
  toast.group.machine({
    pauseOnPageIdle: true,
    pauseOnInteraction: true,
  }),
)

// Programmatically pause a toast (by `id`)
// `id` is the return value of `api.create(...)`
toast.pause(id)
```

## Limiting the number of toasts

Toasts are great but displaying too many of them can sometimes hamper the user
experience. To limit the number of visible toasts, pass the `max` property to
the group machine's context.

```jsx {3}
const [state, send] = useMachine(
  toast.group.machine({
    max: 10,
  }),
)
```

## Using toast outside component

The toast module exports an `api` function you can invoke to get access to
specific methods from the `toast.group.connect`.

The methods available are `count`, `isVisible`, `upsert`, `dismiss`, `remove`,
`promise`.

> For toast to work outside component, ensure you've setup the toast group as
> defined in the [usage guide](#usage)

```jsx
import * as toast from "@zag-js/toast"

function fetchData() {
  const promise = fetch("/api/data").then((res) => res.json())
  toast.api().promise(promise, {
    loading: {
      title: "Loading",
      description: "Please wait...",
    },
    success: (data) => ({
      title: "Success",
      description: "Your request has been completed",
    }),
    error: (err) => ({
      title: "Error",
      description: "An error has occurred",
    }),
  })
}
```

## Changing the space between toasts

When multiple toasts are rendered, a gutter of `1rem` is applied between each
toast. To change this value, pass the `gutter` context property.

```jsx {3}
const [state, send] = useMachine(
  toast.group.machine({
    gutter: "50px",
  }),
)
```

## Changing the viewport offsets

The toast group's container has `position: fixed` css property applied to it
based on the placement set. To change the viewport offsets of the toast group's
container, pass the `offsets` context property.

```jsx {4-8}
const [state, send] = useMachine(
  toast.group.machine({
    offsets: {
      top: "10px",
      right: "10px",
      bottom: "10px",
      left: "10px",
    },
  }),
)
```

## Custom render functions

When using the toast within a design system, you might want consumers to provide
custom render functions that return the toast's JSX element.

Here's how to achieve that:

```jsx
// 1. Update toast to support custom render
function ToastItem(props) {
  const [state, send] = useActor(props.actor)
  const api = toast.connect(state, send)

  // Custom toast JSX defined when `toast.create()` is called
  const jsx = api.render()

  if (jsx) {
    return <div {...api.rootProps}>{jsx}</div>
  }

  // Default toast JSX
  return (
    <div {...api.rootProps}>
      <p {...api.titleProps}>{api.title}</p>
      <p {...api.descriptionProps}>{api.description}</p>
      <p>{api.type === "loading" ? <BeatLoader /> : null}</p>
      <button onClick={api.dismiss}>Close</button>
    </div>
  )
}

// 2. Later in the app, provide custom JSX
toast.create({
  title: "Welcome",
  description: "This is a toast",
  type: "info",
  render(props) {
    return (
      <div
        id={props.id}
        style={{ background: props.type === "loading" ? "pink" : "red" }}
      >
        <p>{props.title}</p>
        <p>{props.description}</p>
        <button onClick={props.dismiss}>Close</button>
      </div>
    )
  },
})
```

## Styling guide

### Toast styling

When a toast is created and the `api.rootProps` from the `toast.connect` is
used, the toast will have a `data-type` that matches the specified `type` at its
creation.

You can use this property to style the toast.

```css
[data-part="root"][data-type="info"] {
  /* Styles for the specific toast type */
}

[data-part="root"][data-type="error"] {
  /* Styles for the error toast type */
}

[data-part="root"][data-type="success"] {
  /* Styles for the success toast type */
}

[data-part="root"][data-type="custom"] {
  /* Styles for the custom toast type */
}

[data-part="root"][data-type="loading"] {
  /* Styles for the loading toast type */
}
```

When the toast is visible, we attach a `data-open` attribute to the toast's
root. A common use-case for this is to specify the entry and exit animations for
the toast.

> Remember every toast has a `500ms` delay before it is removed from the DOM.
> Keep your exit animations within this range.

```css
[data-part="root"] {
  animation-name: fadein;
  animation-fill-mode: forwards;
  animation-duration: 0.2s;
}

[data-part="root"]:not([data-open]) {
  animation-duration: 0.3s;
  animation-name: fadeout;
}
```
