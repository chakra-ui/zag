# Carousel

an accessible carousel component that leverages native CSS Scroll Snap for
smooth, performant scrolling between slides.

<Resources pkg="@zag-js/carousel" />

<Showcase id="Carousel" />

**Features**

- Uses native CSS Scroll Snap.
- Supports horizontal and vertical orientations.
- Supports alignment of slides (start, center or end alignment).
- Show multiple slides at a time.
- Supports looping and auto-playing.
- Supports custom spacing between slides.

## Installation

To use the carousel machine in your project, run the following command in your
command line:

<CodeSnippet id="carousel/installation.mdx" />

This command will install the framework agnostic carousel logic and the reactive
utilities for your framework of choice.

## Anatomy

To set up the carousel correctly, you'll need to understand its anatomy and how
we name its parts.

> Each part includes a `data-part` attribute to help identify them in the DOM.

<Anatomy id="carousel" />

## Usage

First, import the carousel package into your project

```jsx
import * as carousel from "@zag-js/carousel"
```

The carousel package exports two key functions:

- `machine` â€” The state machine logic for the carousel widget.
- `connect` â€” The function that translates the machine's state to JSX attributes
  and event handlers.

> You'll also need to provide a unique `id` to the `useMachine` hook. This is
> used to ensure that every part has a unique identifier.

Next, import the required hooks and functions for your framework and use the
carousel machine in your project ðŸ”¥

<CodeSnippet id="carousel/usage.mdx" />

## Vertical carousel

To create a vertical carousel, set the `orientation` property in the machine's
context to `vertical`.

```jsx {3}
const [state, send] = useMachine(
  carousel.machine({
    orientation: "vertical",
  }),
)
```

## Setting the initial slide

To set the initial slide of the carousel, pass the `page` property to the
machine's context.

The `page` corresponds to the scroll snap position index based on the layout. It
does not necessarily correspond to the index of the slide in the carousel.

```jsx {3}
const [state, send] = useMachine(
  carousel.machine({
    page: 2,
  }),
)
```

## Setting the number of slides to show at a time

To customize number of slides to show at a time, set the `slidesPerPage`
property in the machine's context. The value must be an integer.

```jsx {3}
const [state, send] = useMachine(
  carousel.machine({
    slidesPerPage: 2,
  }),
)
```

## Setting the number of slides to move at a time

To customize number of slides to move at a time, set the `slidesPerMove`
property in the machine's context. The value must be an integer or `auto`.

> If the value is `auto`, the carousel will move the number of slides equal to
> the number of slides per page.

```jsx {3}
const [state, send] = useMachine(
  carousel.machine({
    slidesPerMove: 2,
  }),
)
```

> Ensure the `slidesPerMove` is less than or equal to the `slidesPerPage` to
> avoid skipping slides.

## Setting the carousel should loop around

To allow looping of slides, set the `loop` property in the machine's context to
`true`.

```jsx {3}
const [state, send] = useMachine(
  carousel.machine({
    loop: true,
  }),
)
```

## Setting the gap between slides

To customize spacing between slides, set the `spacing` property in the machine's
context to a valid CSS unit.

```jsx {3}
const [state, send] = useMachine(
  carousel.machine({
    spacing: "16px",
  }),
)
```

## Listening for page changes

When the carousel page changes, the `onPageChange` callback is invoked.

```jsx {3-6}
const [state, send] = useMachine(
  carousel.machine({
    onPageChange(details) {
      // details => { page: number }
      console.log("selected page:", details.page)
    },
  }),
)
```

## Dragging the carousel

To allow dragging the carousel with the mouse, set the `allowMouseDrag` property
in the machine's context to `true`.

```jsx {3}
const [state, send] = useMachine(
  carousel.machine({
    allowMouseDrag: true,
  }),
)
```

## Autoplaying the carousel

To allow the carousel to autoplay, set the `autoplay` property in the machine's
context to `true`.

```jsx {3}
const [state, send] = useMachine(
  carousel.machine({
    autoplay: true,
  }),
)
```

Alternatively, you can configure the autoplay interval by setting the `delay`
property in the machine's context.

```jsx {3}
const [state, send] = useMachine(
  carousel.machine({
    autoplay: { delay: 2000 },
  }),
)
```

## Styling guide

Earlier, we mentioned that each carousel part has a `data-part` attribute added
to them to select and style them in the DOM.

```css
[data-part="item"] {
  /* styles for the root part */
}

[data-part="viewport"] {
  /* styles for the viewport part */
}

[data-part="item-group"] {
  /* styles for the item-group part */
}

[data-part="item"] {
  /* styles for the item part */
}

[data-part="next-trigger"] {
  /* styles for the next-trigger part */
}

[data-part="prev-trigger"] {
  /* styles for the prev-trigger part */
}

[data-part="indicator-group"] {
  /* styles for the indicator-group part */
}

[data-part="indicator"] {
  /* styles for the indicator part */
}
```

### Active state

When a carousel's indicator is active, a `data-current` attribute is set on the
indicator.

```css
[data-part="indicator"][data-current] {
  /* styles for the indicator's active state */
}
```
