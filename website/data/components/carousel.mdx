# Carousel

A slideshow component that cycles through elements.

<Resources pkg="@zag-js/carousel" />

<Showcase id="Carousel" />

**Features**

- Support for horizontal and vertical orientations.
- Supports alignment of slides (start, center or end alignment).
- Supports custom number of slides to show at a time.
- Supports looping of slides.
- Supports custom spacing between slides.

## Installation

To use the carousel machine in your project, run the following command in your
command line:

<CodeSnippet id="carousel/installation.mdx" />

This command will install the framework agnostic carousel logic and the reactive
utilities for your framework of choice.

## Anatomy

To set up the carousel correctly, you'll need to understand its anatomy and how
we name its parts.

> Each part includes a `data-part` attribute to help identify them in the DOM.

<Anatomy id="carousel" />

## Usage

First, import the carousel package into your project

```jsx
import * as carousel from "@zag-js/carousel"
```

The carousel package exports two key functions:

- `machine` â€” The state machine logic for the carousel widget.
- `connect` â€” The function that translates the machine's state to JSX attributes
  and event handlers.

> You'll also need to provide a unique `id` to the `useMachine` hook. This is
> used to ensure that every part has a unique identifier.

Next, import the required hooks and functions for your framework and use the
carousel machine in your project ðŸ”¥

<CodeSnippet id="carousel/usage.mdx" />

## Changing the orientation

By default, the carousel is assumed to be horizontal. To change the orientation
to vertical, set the `orientation` property in the machine's context to
`vertical`.

In this mode, the carousel will use the arrow up and down keys to
increment/decrement its value.

> Don't forget to change the styles of the vertical carousel by specifying its
> height.

```jsx {3}
const [state, send] = useMachine(
  carousel.machine({
    orientation: "vertical",
  }),
)
```

## Setting the initial slide

To set the initial slide of the carousel, pass the `index` property to the
machine's context.

```jsx {3}
const [state, send] = useMachine(
  carousel.machine({
    index: 2,
  }),
)
```

## Setting the alignment of the slides

To set the alignment, set the `align` property in the machine's context to the
`start`, `center`, or `end` value.

```jsx {3}
const [state, send] = useMachine(
  carousel.machine({
    align: "center",
  }),
)
```

## Setting the number of slides to show at a time

To customize number of slides to show, set the `slidesPerView` property in the
machine's context to a number value or `auto` string.

```jsx {3}
const [state, send] = useMachine(
  carousel.machine({
    slidesPerView: 2,
  }),
)
```

## Setting the carousel should loop around

To allow looping of slides, set the `loop` property in the machine's context to
`true`.

```jsx {3}
const [state, send] = useMachine(
  carousel.machine({
    loop: true,
  }),
)
```

## Setting the amount of space between slides

To customize spacing between slides, set the `spacing` property in the machine's
context to a valid CSS unit.

```jsx {3}
const [state, send] = useMachine(
  carousel.machine({
    spacing: "16px",
  }),
)
```

## Listening for changes

When the carousel slide changes, the `onIndexChange` callback is invoked.

```jsx {3-6}
const [state, send] = useMachine(
  carousel.machine({
    onIndexChange(details) {
      // details => { index: number }
      console.log("selected slide:", details.index)
    },
  }),
)
```

## Styling guide

Earlier, we mentioned that each carousel part has a `data-part` attribute added
to them to select and style them in the DOM.

```css
[data-part="item"] {
  /* styles for the root part */
}

[data-part="viewport"] {
  /* styles for the viewport part */
}

[data-part="item-group"] {
  /* styles for the item-group part */
}

[data-part="item"] {
  /* styles for the item part */
}

[data-part="next-trigger"] {
  /* styles for the next-trigger part */
}

[data-part="prev-trigger"] {
  /* styles for the prev-trigger part */
}

[data-part="indicator-group"] {
  /* styles for the indicator-group part */
}

[data-part="indicator"] {
  /* styles for the indicator part */
}
```

### Active state

When a carousel's indicator is active, a `data-current` attribute is set on the
indicator.

```css
[data-part="indicator"][data-current] {
  /* styles for the indicator's active state */
}
```
