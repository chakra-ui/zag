# Pressable

Pressable handles press interactions across mouse, touch, keyboard, and screen
readers.

<Resources pkg="@zag-js/pressable" />

<Showcase id="Pressable" />

**Features**

- Handles mouse and touch events
- Handles Enter or Space key presses
- Handles screen reader virtual clicks
- Uses pointer events where available, with fallbacks to mouse and touch events
- Normalizes focus behavior on mouse and touch interactions across browsers
- Handles disabling text selection on mobile while the press interaction is
  active
- Normalizes many cross browser inconsistencies

## Installation

To use the pressable machine in your project, run the following command in your
command line:

<CodeSnippet id="pressable/installation.mdx" />

This command will install the framework agnostic pressable logic and the
reactive utilities for your framework of choice.

## Usage

First, import the pressable package into your project

```jsx
import * as pressable from "@zag-js/pressable"
```

The pressable package exports two key functions:

- `machine` â€” The state machine logic for the pressable widget.
- `connect` â€” The function that translates the machine's state to JSX attributes
  and event handlers.

> You'll also need to provide a unique `id` to the `useMachine` hook. This is
> used to ensure that every pressable has a unique identifier. Next, import the
> required hooks and functions for your framework and use the pressable machine
> in your project ðŸ”¥

<CodeSnippet id="pressable/usage.mdx" />

## Disabling the pressable

To make pressable disabled, set the context's `disabled` property to true

```jsx {3}
const [state, send] = useMachine(
  pressable.machine({
    disabled: true,
  }),
)
```


## Handlers

The pressable fires these handlers

| Property       | Description                                                                                                             |
| -------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `onPress`      | Handler that is called when the press is released over the target.                                                      |
| `onPressStart` | Handler that is called when a press interaction starts.                                                                 |
| `onPressEnd`   | Handler that is called when a press interaction ends, either over the target or when the pointer leaves the target.     |
| `onPressUp`    | Handler that is called when a press is released over the target, regardless of whether it started on the target or not. |
| `onLongPress`  | Handler that is called when the element has been pressed for 500 milliseconds                                           |

Each of these handlers is fired with a PressEvent, which exposes information
about the target and the type of event that triggered the interaction.

| Property        | Description                                      | Type                                                              |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `type`          | The type of press event being fired.             | `pressstart` or `pressend` or `pressup` or `press` or `longpress` |
| `pointerType`   | The pointer type that triggered the press event. | `PointerType`                                                     |
| `target`        | The target element of the press event.           | `HTMLElement`                                                     |
| `originalEvent` | The original fired event                         | `PointerEvent`                                                    |

## Styling guide

### Pressed State

When the pressable element is pressed, the `data-pressed` attribute is added to
the target

```css
[data-pressed] {
  /* styles for pressable pressed state */
}
```

### Disabled State

When the pressable element is disabled, the `data-disabled` attribute is added
to the target

```css
[data-disabled] {
  /* styles for pressable disabled state */
}
```
