# Slider

A slider allows users to make selections from a range of values. Think of it as
a custom `<input type='range'/>` with the ability to achieve custom styling and
accessibility.

<Resources pkg="@zag-js/slider" />

<Showcase id="Slider" />

**Features**

- Supports centered origin (slider starting at center, instead of start
  position).
- Fully managed keyboard navigation.
- Supports touch or click on track to update value.
- Supports Right-to-Left directionality.
- Support for horizontal and vertical orientations.
- Prevents text selection while dragging.

## Installation

To use the slider machine in your project, run the following command in your
command line:

<CodeSnippet id="slider/installation.mdx" />

This command will install the framework agnostic slider logic and the reactive
utilities for your framework of choice.

## Anatomy

To set up the slider correctly, you'll need to understand its anatomy and how we
name its parts.

> Each part includes a `data-part` attribute to help identify them in the DOM.

<Anatomy id="slider" />

On a high level, the slider consists of:

- **Root**: The root container for the slider
- **Label**: The accessible label for the slider
- **Control**: The container for the slider's track and thumb
- **Track**: The slider's track element
- **Range**: The element that visually represents the slider's range
- **Thumb**: The control element used to drag the slider
- **Output**: The element that displays the current value of the slider

## Usage

First, import the slider package into your project

```jsx
import * as slider from "@zag-js/slider"
```

The slider package exports two key functions:

- `machine` — The state machine logic for the slider widget as described in the
  WAI-ARIA spec.
- `connect` — The function that translates the machine's state to JSX attributes
  and event handlers.

> You'll need to provide a unique `id` to the `useMachine` hook. This is used to
> ensure that every part has a unique identifier.

Next, import the required hooks and functions for your framework and use the
slider machine in your project 🔥

<UsageCodeSnippet id="slider/usage.mdx" style="slider" />

## Changing the orientation

By default, the slider is assumed to be horizontal. To change the orientation to
vertical, set the `orientation` property in the machine's context to `vertical`.

In this mode, the slider will use the arrow up and down keys to
increment/decrement its value.

> Don't forget to change the styles of the vertical slider by specifying its
> height

```jsx {3}
const [state, send] = useMachine(
  slider.machine({
    orientation: "vertical",
  }),
)
```

## Setting the initial value

```jsx {3}
const [state, send] = useMachine(
  slider.machine({
    value: 30,
  }),
)
```

## Specifying the minimum and maximum

By default, the minimum is `0` and the maximum is `100`. If that's not what you
want, you can easily specify different bounds by changing the values of the min
and/or max attributes.

For example, to ask the user for a value between `-10` and `10`, you can use:

```jsx {3-4}
const [state, send] = useMachine(
  slider.machine({
    min: -10,
    max: 10,
  }),
)
```

## Setting the value's granularity

By default, the granularity, is `1`, meaning that the value is always an
integer. You can change the step attribute to control the granularity.

For example, If you need a value between `5` and `10`, accurate to two decimal
places, you should set the value of step to `0.01`:

```jsx {5}
const [state, send] = useMachine(
  slider.machine({
    min: 5,
    max: 10,
    step: 0.01,
  }),
)
```

## Listening for changes

When the slider value changes, the `onChange` and `onChangeEnd` callbacks are
invoked. You can use this to setup custom behaviors in your app.

```jsx {3-8}
const [state, send] = useMachine(
  slider.machine({
    onChange(value) {
      console.log("value is changing to:", value)
    },
    onChangeEnd(value) {
      console.log("value has changed to:", value)
    },
  }),
)
```


## Changing the start position

By default, the slider's "zero position" is usually at the start position (left
in LTR and right in RTL).

In scenarios where the value represents an offset (or relative value), it might
be useful to change the "zero position" to center. To do this, pass the `origin`
context property to `center`.

```jsx {3}
const [state, send] = useMachine(
  slider.machine({
    origin: "center",
  }),
)
```

## Usage within forms

To use slider within forms, use the exposed `inputProps` from the `connect`
function and ensure you pass `name` value to the machine's context. It will
render a hidden input and ensure the value changes get propagated to the form
correctly.

```jsx {3}
const [state, send] = useMachine(
  slider.machine({
    name: "quantity",
  }),
)
```

## RTL Support

The slider has built-in support for RTL alignment and interaction. In the RTL
mode, operations are performed from right to left, meaning, the left arrow key
will increment and the right arrow key will decrement.

To enable RTL support, pass the `dir: rtl` context property

```jsx {3}
const [state, send] = useMachine(
  slider.machine({
    dir: "rtl",
  }),
)
```

> While we take care of the interactions in RTL mode, you'll have to ensure you
> apply the correct CSS styles to flip the layout.

## Using slider marks

To show marks or ticks along the slider track, use the exposed
`api.getMarkerProps()` method to position the slider marks relative to the
track.

## Styling guide

Earlier, we mentioned that each slider part has a `data-part` attribute added to
them to select and style them in the DOM.

### Focused State

When the slider thumb is focused, the `data-focus` attribute is added to the
root, control, thumb and label parts.

```css
[data-part="root"][data-focus] {
  /* styles for root focus state */
}

[data-part="thumb"]:focus {
  /* styles for thumb focus state */
}

[data-part="control"][data-focus] {
  /* styles for control focus state */
}

[data-part="track"][data-focus] {
  /* styles for track focus state */
}

[data-part="range"][data-focus] {
  /* styles for range focus state */
}
```

### Disabled State

When the slider is disabled, the `data-disabled` attribute is added to the root,
label, control and thumb.

```css
[data-part="root"][data-disabled] {
  /* styles for root disabled state */
}

[data-part="label"][data-disabled] {
  /* styles for label disabled state */
}

[data-part="control"][data-disabled] {
  /* styles for control disabled state */
}

[data-part="output"][data-disabled] {
  /* styles for output disabled state */
}

[data-part="thumb"][data-disabled] {
  /* styles for thumb disabled state */
}

[data-part="range"][data-disabled] {
  /* styles for thumb disabled state */
}
```

### Invalid State

When the slider is invalid, the `data-invalid` attribute is added to the root,
track, range, label, and thumb parts.

```css
[data-part="root"][data-invalid] {
  /* styles for root invalid state */
}

[data-part="label"][data-invalid] {
  /* styles for label invalid state */
}

[data-part="control"][data-invalid] {
  /* styles for control invalid state */
}

[data-part="output"][data-invalid] {
  /* styles for output invalid state */
}

[data-part="thumb"][data-invalid] {
  /* styles for thumb invalid state */
}

[data-part="range"][data-invalid] {
  /* styles for range invalid state */
}
```

### Orientation

```css
[data-part="root"][data-orientation="(horizontal|vertical)"] {
  /* styles for horizontal or vertical  */
}

[data-part="thumb"][data-orientation="(horizontal|vertical)"] {
  /* styles for horizontal or vertical  */
}

[data-part="track"][data-orientation="(horizontal|vertical)"] {
  /* styles for horizontal or vertical  */
}
```

### Styling the markers

```css
[data-part="marker"][data-state="(at|under|over)-value"] {
  /* styles for when the value exceeds the marker's value */
}
```

## Methods and Properties

The slider's `api` provides properties and methods you can use to
programmatically read and set the slider's value.
