# Rating

Rating allows a user to add and remove rating to an item.

<Resources pkg="@zag-js/rating" />

<Showcase id="Rating" />

**Features**

- Syncs with `disabled` state of fieldset
- Syncs with form `reset` events

## Installation

To use the rating machine in your project, run the following command in your
command line:

<CodeSnippet id="rating/installation.mdx" />

This command will install the framework agnostic rating logic and the reactive
utilities for your framework of choice.

## Anatomy

To set up the rating correctly, you'll need to understand its anatomy and how we
name its parts.

> Each part includes a `data-part` attribute to help identify them in the DOM.

<Anatomy id="rating" />

On a high level, the rating consists of:

- **Root**: The root container for the rating
- **Label**: The label that gives the user information on the rating
- **Item**: The element that visually represents the each rating item.
- **Item Group**: The radiogroup wrapper for the rating items.
- **Input**: The native html input that is visually hidden in the rating.

## Usage

First, import the rating package into your project

```jsx
import * as rating from "@zag-js/rating"
```

The rating package exports two key functions:

- `machine` â€” The state machine logic for the rating widget.
- `connect` â€” The function that translates the machine's state to JSX attributes
  and event handlers.

> You'll also need to provide a unique `id` to the `useMachine` hook. This is
> used to ensure that every part has a unique identifier.

Next, import the required hooks and functions for your framework and use the
rating machine in your project ðŸ”¥

<CodeSnippet id="rating/usage.mdx" />

## Disabling the rating

To make rating disabled, set the context's `disabled` property to true

```jsx {3}
const [state, send] = useMachine(
  rating.machine({
    disabled: true,
  }),
)
```

## Making the rating readonly

To make rating readonly, set the context's `readOnly` property to true

```jsx {3}
const [state, send] = useMachine(
  rating.machine({
    readOnly: true,
  }),
)
```

## Setting the initial value

To set the rating's initial value, set the context's `value` property.

```jsx {3}
const [state, send] = useMachine(
  rating.machine({
    value: 2.5,
  }),
)
```

## Listening for changes

When the rating value changes, the `onChange` callback is invoked.

```jsx {3-8}
const [state, send] = useMachine(
  rating.machine({
    onChange({ value }) {
      console.log("rating value is:", value)
      // '1' | '2.5' | '4'
    },
  }),
)
```


## Usage within forms

To use rating within forms, use the exposed `inputProps` from the `connect`
function and ensure you pass `name` value to the machine's context. It will
render a hidden input and ensure the value changes get propagated to the form
correctly.

```jsx {3}
const [state, send] = useMachine(
  rating.machine({
    name: "rating",
  }),
)
```

## Styling guide

Earlier, we mentioned that each rating part has a `data-part` attribute added to
them to select and style them in the DOM.

### Disabled State

When the rating is disabled, the `data-disabled` attribute is added to the
rating, control and label parts.

```css
[data-part="rating"][data-disabled] {
  /* styles for rating disabled state */
}

[data-part="label"][data-disabled] {
  /* styles for rating control disabled state */
}

[data-part="input"][data-disabled] {
  /* styles for rating label disabled state */
}
```

### Checked State

When the rating is checked, the `data-checked` attribute is added to the rating
part.

```css
[data-part="rating"][data-checked] {
  /* styles for rating checked state */
}
```

### Readonly State

When the rating is readonly, the `data-readonly` attribute is added to the
rating part.

```css
[data-part="rating"][data-readonly] {
  /* styles for rating readonly state */
}
```

### Highlighted

When a rating is highlighted, the `data-highlighted` attribute is added to the
rating part.

```css
[data-part="rating"][data-highlighted] {
  /* styles for highlighted rating */
}
```

### Half rating

When a rating is half, the `data-half` attribute is added to the rating part.

```css
[data-part="rating"][data-half] {
  /* styles for half rating */
}
```
