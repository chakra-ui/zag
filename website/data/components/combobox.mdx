# Combobox

A combobox is an input widget with an associated popup that enables users to
select a value from a collection of possible values.

<Resources pkg="@zag-js/combobox" />

<Showcase id="Combobox" />

**Features**

- Support for filtering a list of options by typing.
- Support for disabled options
- Support for custom user input values
- Support for mouse, touch, and keyboard interactions
- Keyboard support for opening the combo box list box using the arrow keys,
  including automatically focusing the first or last item accordingly

## Installation

To use the combobox machine in your project, run the following command in your
command line:

<CodeSnippet id="combobox/installation.mdx" />

This command will install the framework agnostic combobox logic and the reactive
utilities for your framework of choice.

## Anatomy

To set up the combobox correctly, you'll need to understand its anatomy and how
we name its parts.

> Each part includes a `data-part` attribute to help identify them in the DOM.

<Anatomy id="combobox" />

On a high level, the combobox consists of:

- **Root**: The root container for the combobox
- **Label**: The label that gives the user information on the combobox
- **Positioner**: The element that positions the combobox dynamically.
- **Content**: The element that contains the options.
- **Trigger**: The element that toggles the combobox menu.

## Usage

First, import the combobox package into your project

```jsx
import * as combobox from "@zag-js/combobox"
```

The combobox package exports two key functions:

- `machine` — The state machine logic for the combobox widget.
- `connect` — The function that translates the machine's state to JSX attributes
  and event handlers.

Next, import the required hooks and functions for your framework and use the
combobox machine in your project 🔥

<CodeSnippet id="combobox/usage.mdx" />

## Disabling the combobox

To make a combobox disabled, set the context's `disabled` property to `true`

```jsx {3}
const [state, send] = useMachine(
  combobox.machine({
    disabled: true,
  }),
)
```

## Disabling an option

To make a combobox option disabled, set the `disabled` property of
`getOptionProps` to `true`

```jsx {9}
const [state, send] = useMachine(combobox.machine())

return {
  <li
    {...api.getOptionProps({
      label: item.label,
      value: item.code,
      index:index,
      disabled: item.disabled,
    })}
  />
}
```

## Making the combobox readonly

To make a combobox readonly, set the context's `readOnly` property to `true`

```jsx {3}
const [state, send] = useMachine(
  combobox.machine({
    readOnly: true,
  }),
)
```

## Listening for highlight changes

When an option is highlighted with the pointer or keyboard, the
`highlightedOption` property in the machine's context is updated. You can listen
for this change and do something with it.

```jsx {4-7}
const [state, send] = useMachine(
  combobox.machine({
    id: useId(),
    onHighlight(details) {
      // details => { label: string, value: string, relatedTarget: HTMLElement | null }
      console.log(details)
    },
  }),
)
```

## Listening for selection changes

When an option is selected, the `selectedOption` property in the machine's
context is updated. You can listen for this change and do something with it.

```jsx {3-6}
const [state, send] = useMachine(
  combobox.machine({
    onSelect(details) {
      // details => { label: string, value: string, relatedTarget: HTMLElement | null }
      console.log(details)
    },
  }),
)
```

## Usage within forms

The combobox works when placed within a form and the form is submitted. We
achieve this by:

- ensuring we emit the input event as the value changes.
- adding a `name` attribute to the input so the value can be accessed in the
  `FormData`.

To get this feature working you need to pass a `name` option to the context.

```jsx {3}
const [state, send] = useMachine(
  combobox.machine({
    name: "countries",
  }),
)
```

## Styling guide

Earlier, we mentioned that each combobox part has a `data-part` attribute added
to them to select and style them in the DOM.

### Open and closed state

When the combobox is open or closed, the `data-state` attribute is added to the
content,control, input and control parts.

```css
[data-part="control"][data-state="open|closed"] {
  /* styles for control open or state */
}

[data-part="input"][data-state="open|closed"] {
  /* styles for control open or state */
}

[data-part="trigger"][data-state="open|closed"] {
  /* styles for control open or state */
}

[data-part="content"][data-state="open|closed"] {
  /* styles for control open or state */
}
```

### Focused State

When the combobox is focused, the `data-focus` attribute is added to the control
and label parts.

```css
[data-part="control"][data-focus] {
  /* styles for control focus state */
}

[data-part="label"][data-focus] {
  /* styles for label focus state */
}
```

### Disabled State

When the combobox is disabled, the `data-disabled` attribute is added to the
label, control, trigger and option parts.

```css
[data-part="label"][data-disabled] {
  /* styles for label disabled state */
}

[data-part="control"][data-disabled] {
  /* styles for control disabled state */
}

[data-part="trigger"][data-disabled] {
  /* styles for trigger disabled state */
}

[data-part="option"][data-disabled] {
  /* styles for option disabled state */
}
```

### Invalid State

When the combobox is invalid, the `data-invalid` attribute is added to the root,
label, control and input parts.

```css
[data-part="root"][data-invalid] {
  /* styles for root invalid state */
}

[data-part="label"][data-invalid] {
  /* styles for label invalid state */
}

[data-part="control"][data-invalid] {
  /* styles for control invalid state */
}

[data-part="input"][data-invalid] {
  /* styles for input invalid state */
}
```

## Methods and Properties

The combobox's `api` exposes the following methods:
