# Steps

Steps are used to guide users through a series of steps in a process. It's a
great way to break down a complex process into smaller, more manageable steps.

<Resources pkg="@zag-js/steps" />

<Showcase id="Steps" />

**Features**

- Supports horizontal and vertical orientations.
- Support for changing the active step with the keyboard and pointer.
- Support for linear and non-linear steps.

## Installation

To use the steps machine in your project, run the following command in your
command line:

<CodeSnippet id="steps/installation.mdx" />

This command will install the framework agnostic steps logic and the reactive
utilities for your framework of choice.

## Anatomy

To set up the steps correctly, you'll need to understand its anatomy and how we
name its parts.

> Each part includes a `data-part` attribute to help identify them in the DOM.

<Anatomy id="steps" />

## Usage

First, import the steps package into your project

```jsx
import * as steps from "@zag-js/steps"
```

The steps package exports two key functions:

- `machine` â€” The state machine logic for the steps widget.
- `connect` â€” The function that translates the machine's state to JSX attributes
  and event handlers.

> You'll also need to provide a unique `id` to the `useMachine` hook. This is
> used to ensure that every part has a unique identifier.

Next, import the required hooks and functions for your framework and use the
steps machine in your project ðŸ”¥

<CodeSnippet id="steps/usage.mdx" />

## Setting the initial step

Set the initial step by passing the `step` property to the machine context.

> The value of the `step` property is zero-based index.

```jsx {3}
const [state, send] = useMachine(
  steps.machine({
    step: 1,
  }),
)
```

## Listening for step change

When the active step changes, the machine will invoke the `onStepChange` event

```jsx {3-5}
const [state, send] = useMachine(
  steps.machine({
    onStepChange(details) {
      // details => { step: number }
      console.log(`Step changed to ${details.step}`)
    },
  }),
)
```

## Listening for steps completion

When all steps are completed, the machine will invoke the `onStepComplete` event

```jsx {3-5}
const [state, send] = useMachine(
  steps.machine({
    onStepComplete() {
      console.log("All steps are complete")
    },
  }),
)
```

## Enforcing linear steps

To enforce linear steps, you can set the `linear` prop to `true` when creating
the steps machine. This will prevent users from skipping steps.

```jsx {3}
const [state, send] = useMachine(
  steps.machine({
    linear: true,
  }),
)
```

## Changing the orientation

The steps machine supports both horizontal and vertical orientations. You can
set the `orientation` prop to `horizontal` or `vertical` to change the
orientation of the steps.

```jsx {3}
const [state, send] = useMachine(
  steps.machine({
    orientation: "vertical",
  }),
)
```

## Styling guide

Earlier, we mentioned that each steps part has a `data-part` attribute added to
them to select and style them in the DOM.

```css
[data-scope="steps"][data-part="root"] {
  /* styles for the root part */
}

[data-scope="steps"][data-part="root"][data-orientation="horizontal|vertical"] {
  /* styles for the root part based on orientation */
}

[data-scope="steps"][data-part="list"] {
  /* styles for the list part */
}

[data-scope="steps"][data-part="list"][data-orientation="horizontal|vertical"] {
  /* styles for the list part based on orientation */
}

[data-scope="steps"][data-part="separator"] {
  /* styles for the separator part */
}

[data-scope="steps"][data-part="separator"][data-orientation="horizontal|vertical"] {
  /* styles for the separator part based on orientation */
}
```

### Current step

To style the current step, you can use the `data-current` attribute.

```css
[data-scope="steps"][data-part="item"][data-current] {
  /* item styles for the current step */
}

[data-scope="steps"][data-part="separator"][data-current] {
  /* separator styles for the current step */
}
```

### Completed step

To style the completed step, you can use the `data-complete` attribute.

```css
[data-scope="steps"][data-part="item"][data-complete] {
  /* item styles for the completed step */
}

[data-scope="steps"][data-part="separator"][data-complete] {
  /* separator styles for the completed step */
}
```

### Incomplete step

To style the incomplete step, you can use the `data-incomplete` attribute.

```css
[data-scope="steps"][data-part="item"][data-incomplete] {
  /* item styles for the incomplete step */
}

[data-scope="steps"][data-part="separator"][data-incomplete] {
  /* separator styles for the incomplete step */
}
```
