# Tooltip

A tooltip is a brief, informative message that appears when a user interacts
with an element. Tooltips are usually initiated when a button is focused or
hovered.

<Resources pkg="@zag-js/tooltip" />

<Showcase id="Tooltip" />

**Features**

- Show tooltip on hover and focus.
- Hide tooltip on esc or pointer down.
- Only one tooltip shows at a time.
- Labeling support for screen readers via `aria-describedby`.
- Custom show and hide delay support.
- Matches native tooltip behavior with delay on hover of first tooltip and no
  delay on subsequent tooltips.

## Installation

To use the tooltip machine in your project, run the following command in your
command line:

<CodeSnippet id="tooltip/installation.mdx" />

This command will install the framework agnostic tooltip logic and the reactive
utilities for your framework of choice.

## Anatomy

To set up the tooltip correctly, you'll need to understand its anatomy and how
we name its parts.

> Each part includes a `data-part` attribute to help identify them in the DOM.

<Anatomy id="tooltip" />

On a high level, the tooltip consists of:

- **Trigger**: The trigger for the tooltip.
- **Positioner**: The element that dynamically positions the tooltip.
- **Arrow**: The arrow that points to the trigger.
- **Content**: The element that houses the content of the tooltip.

## Usage

First, import the tooltip package into your project

```jsx
import * as tooltip from "@zag-js/tooltip"
```

The tooltip package exports two key functions:

- `machine` â€” The state machine logic for the tooltip widget.
- `connect` â€” The function that translates the machine's state to JSX attributes
  and event handlers.

To get the tooltip working correct, you'll need to:

- Setup the tooltip portal, this is a shared container for all tooltips
- Add the `triggerProps`, and `tooltipProps` to the elements

> You'll also need to provide a unique `id` to the `useMachine` hook. This is
> used to ensure that every part has a unique identifier.

Next, import the required hooks and functions for your framework and use the
tooltip machine in your project ðŸ”¥

<CodeSnippet id="tooltip/usage.mdx" />

## Customizing the timings

By default, the tooltip is designed to open after `1000ms` and close after
`500ms`. You can customize this by passing the `openDelay` and `closeDelay`
context properties.

```jsx {3-4}
const [state, send] = useMachine(
  tooltip.machine({
    openDelay: 500,
    closeDelay: 200,
  }),
)
```

## Changing the placement

The tooltip uses [floating-ui](https://floating-ui.com/) for dynamic
positioning. You can change the placement of the tooltip by passing the
`positioning.placement` context property to the machine.

```jsx {3-5}
const [state, send] = useMachine(
  tooltip.machine({
    positioning: {
      placement: "bottom-start",
    },
  }),
)
```

You can configure other position-related properties in the `positioning` object.
Here's what the positioning API looks like:

```ts
export type PositioningOptions = {
  /**
   * The strategy to use for positioning
   */
  strategy?: "absolute" | "fixed"
  /**
   * The initial placement of the floating element
   */
  placement?: Placement
  /**
   * The offset of the floating element
   */
  offset?: { mainAxis?: number; crossAxis?: number }
  /**
   * The main axis offset or gap between the reference and floating elements
   */
  gutter?: number
  /**
   * Whether to flip the placement
   */
  flip?: boolean
  /**
   * Whether to make the floating element same width as the reference element
   */
  sameWidth?: boolean
  /**
   * The overflow boundary of the reference element
   */
  boundary?: Boundary
  /**
   * Options to activate auto-update listeners
   */
  listeners?: boolean | AutoUpdateOptions
}
```

## Adding an arrow

To render an arrow within the tooltip, use the `api.arrowProps` and
`api.arrowTipProps`.

```jsx {6-8}
//...
const api = popover.connect(state, send)
//...
return (
  <div {...api.positionerProps}>
    <div {...api.arrowProps}>
      <div {...api.arrowTipProps} />
    </div>
    <div {...api.contentProps}>{/* ... */}</div>
  </div>
)
//...
```

## Pointerdown behavior

By default, the tooltip will close when the pointer is down on its trigger. To
prevent this behavior, pass the `closeOnPointerDown` context property and set it
to `false`.

```jsx {3}
const [state, send] = useMachine(
  tooltip.machine({
    closeOnPointerDown: false,
  }),
)
```

## Closing on Esc

The tooltip is designed to close when the escape key is pressed. To prevent
this, pass the `closeOnEscape` context property and set it to `false`.

```jsx {3}
const [state, send] = useMachine(
  tooltip.machine({
    closeOnEsc: false,
  }),
)
```

## Making the tooltip interactive

Tooltips are interactive by default. That means it'll remain open even the
pointer leaves the trigger and move into the tooltip's content.

To disabled this behavior, pass the `interactive` context property and set it to
`false`.

> Disabling this will violate the
> [WCAG 2.1 success criterion 1.4.13](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#content-on-hover-or-focus)

```jsx {3}
const [state, send] = useMachine(
  tooltip.machine({
    interactive: false,
  }),
)
```

## Using custom labels

By default, the only content announced to them is whatever is in the tooltip. On
some cases you may want the screen readers to know more information about the
trigger (e.g. a notifications system with count).

For this use-case, pass the `aria-label` context property and use the
`labelProps` exposed in the tooltip's connect function.

<CodeSnippet id="tooltip/custom-label.mdx" />

## Events

When the tooltip open or closes, the `onOpen` and `onClose` callbacks are fired.

```jsx {3-8}
const [state, send] = useMachine(
  tooltip.machine({
    onOpen() {
      console.log("Tooltip opened")
    },
    onClose() {
      console.log("Tooltip closed")
    },
  }),
)
```


## Styling guide

Earlier, we mentioned that each tooltip part has a `data-part` attribute added
to them to select and style them in the DOM.

### Open and close states

When the tooltip is open, the `data-expanded` attribute is added to the trigger

```css
[data-part="trigger"][data-expanded] {
  /* styles for the trigger's expanded state */
}
```

### Styling the tooltip

```css
[data-part="content"] {
  /* styles for the content */
}
```

### Styling the arrow

When using arrows within the menu, you can style it using css variables.

```css
[data-part="arrow"] {
  --arrow-size: 20px;
  --arrow-background: red;
}
```

## Methods and Properties

The tooltip's `api` exposes the following methods:
