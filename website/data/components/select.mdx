# Select

A Select component allows users pick a value from predefined options.

<Resources pkg="@zag-js/select" />

<Showcase id="Select" />

**Features**

- Support for selecting a single or multiple option
- Keyboard support for opening the listbox using the arrow keys, including
  automatically focusing the first or last item.
- Support for looping keyboard navigation.
- Support for selecting an item on blur.
- Typeahead to allow selecting options by typing text, even without opening the
  listbox
- Support for Right to Left direction.

## Installation

To use the select machine in your project, run the following command in your
command line:

<CodeSnippet id="select/installation.mdx" />

This command will install the framework agnostic menu logic and the reactive
utilities for your framework of choice.

## Anatomy

To set up the select correctly, you'll need to understand its anatomy and how we
name its parts.

> Each part includes a `data-part` attribute to help identify them in the DOM.

<Anatomy id="select" />

## Usage

First, import the select package into your project

```jsx
import * as select from "@zag-js/select"
```

The select package exports these functions:

- `machine` — The state machine logic for the select.
- `connect` — The function that translates the machine's state to JSX attributes
  and event handlers.
- `collection` - The function that creates a collection interface from an array
  of items.

> You'll need to provide a unique `id` to the `useMachine` hook. This is used to
> ensure that every part has a unique identifier.

Next, import the required hooks and functions for your framework and use the
select machine in your project 🔥

<CodeSnippet id="select/usage.mdx" />

## Setting the initial value

To set the initial value of the select, pass the `value` property to the select
machine's context.

> The `value` property must be an array of strings. If selecting a single value,
> pass an array with a single string.

```jsx {14}
const collection = select.collection({
  items: [
    { label: "Nigeria", value: "ng" },
    { label: "Ghana", value: "gh" },
    { label: "Kenya", value: "ke" },
    //...
  ],
})

const [state, send] = useMachine(
  select.machine({
    id: useId(),
    collection,
    value: ["ng"],
  }),
)
```

## Selecting multiple values

To allow selecting multiple values, set the `multiple` property in the machine's
context to `true`.

```jsx {5}
const [state, send] = useMachine(
  select.machine({
    id: useId(),
    collection,
    multiple: true,
  }),
)
```

## Usage within a form

To use select within a form, you'll need to:

- Pass the `name` property to the select machine's context
- Render a hidden `select` element using `api.selectProps`

<CodeSnippet id="select/usage-with-form.mdx" />

## Selecting option on blur

Use the `selectOnBlur` property to allow selecting the highlighted option when
immediately interacting or focusing outside the select (e.g. using the `Tab`
key).

```jsx {5}
const [state, send] = useMachine(
  select.machine({
    id: useId(),
    collection,
    selectOnBlur: true,
  }),
)
```

## Disabling the select

To disable the select, set the `disabled` property in the machine's context to
`true`.

```jsx {5}
const [state, send] = useMachine(
  select.machine({
    id: useId(),
    collection,
    disabled: true,
  }),
)
```

## Disabling an item

To make a combobox option disabled, pass the `isItemDisabled` property to the
collection function.

```jsx {3-5}
const collection = select.collection({
  items: countries,
  isItemDisabled(item) {
    return item.disabled
  },
})

const [state, send] = useMachine(
  select.machine({
    id: useId(),
    collection,
  }),
)
```

## Close on select

This behaviour ensures that the menu is closed when an item is selected and is
`true` by default. It's only concerned with when an item is selected with
pointer, space key or enter key. To disable the behaviour, set the
`closeOnSelect` property in the machine's context to `false`.

```jsx {5}
const [state, send] = useMachine(
  select.machine({
    id: useId(),
    collection,
    closeOnSelect: false,
  }),
)
```

## Looping the keyboard navigation

When navigating with the select using the arrow down and up keys, the select
stops at the first and last options. If you need want the navigation to loop
back to the first or last option, set the `loop: true` in the machine's context.

```jsx {5}
const [state, send] = useMachine(
  select.machine({
    id: useId(),
    collection,
    loop: true,
  }),
)
```

## Listening for highlight changes

When an item is highlighted with the pointer or keyboard, use the
`onHighlightChange` to listen for the change and do something with it.

```jsx {4-7}
const [state, send] = useMachine(
  select.machine({
    id: useId(),
    onHighlightChange(details) {
      // details => { highlightedValue: string | null, highlightedItem: CollectionItem | null }
      console.log(details)
    },
  }),
)
```

## Listening for selection changes

When an item is selected, use the `onValueChange` property to listen for the
change and do something with it.

```jsx {5-7}
const [state, send] = useMachine(
  select.machine({
    id: useId(),
    collection,
    onValueChange(details) {
      // details => { value: string[], items: Item[] }
      console.log(details)
    },
  }),
)
```

## Listening for open and close events

When the select is opened or closed, the `onOpenChange` callback is called. You
can listen for these events and do something with it.

```jsx {5-8}
const [state, send] = useMachine(
  select.machine({
    id: useId(),
    collection,
    onOpenChange(details) {
      // details => { open: boolean }
      console.log("Select opened")
    },
  }),
)
```

## Usage within dialog

When using the select within a dialog, you'll need to avoid rendering the select
in a `Portal` or `Teleport`. This is because the dialog will trap focus within
it, and the select will be rendered outside the dialog.

> Consider designing a `portalled` property in your component to allow you
> decide where to render the select in a portal.

## Styling guide

Earlier, we mentioned that each select part has a `data-part` attribute added to
them to select and style them in the DOM.

### Open and closed state

When the select is open, the trigger and content is given a `data-state`
attribute.

```css
[data-part="trigger"][data-state="open|closed"] {
  /* styles for open or closed state */
}

[data-part="content"][data-state="open|closed"] {
  /* styles for open or closed state */
}
```

### Selected state

When an item is selected, it is given a `data-selected` attribute.

```css
[data-part="item"][data-selected] {
  /* styles for selected state */
}
```

### Highlighted state

When an item is higlighted, via keyboard navigation or pointer, it is given a
`data-highlighted` attribute.

```css
[data-part="item"][data-highlighted] {
  /* styles for highlighted state */
}
```

### Invalid state

When the select is invalid, the label and trigger is given a `data-invalid`
attribute.

```css
[data-part="label"][data-invalid] {
  /* styles for invalid state */
}

[data-part="trigger"][data-invalid] {
  /* styles for invalid state */
}
```

### Disabled state

When the select is disabled, the trigger and label is given a `data-disabled`
attribute.

```css
[data-part="trigger"][data-disabled] {
  /* styles for disabled select state */
}

[data-part="label"][data-disabled] {
  /* styles for disabled label state */
}

[data-part="item"][data-disabled] {
  /* styles for disabled option state */
}
```

> Optionally, when an item is disabled, it is given a `data-disabled` attribute.

### Empty state

When no option is selected, the trigger is given a `data-placeholder-shown`
attribute.

```css
[data-part="trigger"][data-placeholder-shown] {
  /* styles for empty select state */
}
```
