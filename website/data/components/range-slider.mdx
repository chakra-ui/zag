# Range Slider

A range slider is a multi-thumb slider used to select a range between two
numbers.

<Resources pkg="@zag-js/range-slider" />

<Showcase id="RangeSlider" />

**Features**

- Fully managed keyboard navigation.
- Supports touch or click on track to update value.
- Supports Right-to-Left directionality.
- Support for horizontal and vertical orientations.
- Prevents text selection while dragging.

## Installation

To use the range slider machine in your project, run the following command in
your command line:

<CodeSnippet id="range-slider/installation.mdx" />

This command will install the framework agnostic range slider logic and the
reactive utilities for your framework of choice.

## Anatomy

To set up the slider correctly, you'll need to understand its anatomy and how we
name its parts.

> Each part includes a `data-part` attribute to help identify them in the DOM.

<Anatomy id="slider" />

On a high level, the slider consists of:

- **Root**: The root container for the slider
- **Label**: The accessible label for the slider
- **Control**: The container for the slider's track and thumb
- **Track**: The slider's track element
- **Range**: The element that visually represents the slider's range
- **Thumb**: The control element used to drag the slider
- **Output**: The element that displays the current value of the slider

## Usage

First, import the range slider package into your project

```jsx
import * as rangeSlider from "@zag-js/range-slider"
```

The range slider package exports two key functions:

- `machine` — The state machine logic for the slider widget as described in the
  WAI-ARIA spec.
- `connect` — The function that translates the machine's state to JSX attributes
  and event handlers.

> You'll need to provide a unique `id` to the `useMachine` hook. This is used to
> ensure that every part has a unique identifier.

Next, import the required hooks and functions for your framework and use the
range slider machine in your project 🔥

<UsageCodeSnippet id="range-slider/usage.mdx" style="slider" />

## Changing the orientation

By default, the slider is assumed to be horizontal. To change the orientation to
vertical, set the `orientation` property in the machine's context to `vertical`.

In this mode, the slider will use the arrow up and down keys to
increment/decrement its value.

> Don't forget to change the styles of the vertical slider by specifying its
> height

```jsx {3}
const [state, send] = useMachine(
  rangeSlider.machine({
    orientation: "vertical",
  }),
)
```

## Setting the initial value

```jsx {3}
const [state, send] = useMachine(
  rangeSlider.machine({
    values: [30, 60],
  }),
)
```

## Specifying the minimum and maximum

By default, the minimum is `0` and the maximum is `100`. If that's not what you
want, you can easily specify different bounds by changing the values of the min
and/or max attributes.

For example, to ask the user for a value between `-10` and `10`, you can use:

```jsx {3-4}
const [state, send] = useMachine(
  rangeSlider.machine({
    min: -10,
    max: 10,
  }),
)
```

## Setting the value's granularity

By default, the granularity, is `1`, meaning that the value is always an
integer. You can change the step attribute to control the granularity.

For example, If you need a value between `5` and `10`, accurate to two decimal
places, you should set the value of step to `0.01`:

```jsx {5}
const [state, send] = useMachine(
  rangeSlider.machine({
    min: 5,
    max: 10,
    step: 0.01,
  }),
)
```

## Listening for changes

When the slider value changes, the `onChange` and `onChangeEnd` callbacks are
invoked. You can use this to setup custom behaviors in your app.

```jsx {3-8}
const [state, send] = useMachine(
  rangeSlider.machine({
    onChange(values) {
      console.log("value changing to:", values)
    },
    onChangeEnd(values) {
      console.log("value has changed to:", values)
    },
  }),
)
```

## Preventing thumb overlap

By default, the range slider thumbs are allowed to overlap when their values are
equal. To prevent this, use the `minStepsBetweenThumbs` to avoid thumbs with
equal values.

```jsx {3}
const [state, send] = useMachine(
  rangeSlider.machine({
    minStepsBetweenThumbs: 1,
  }),
)
```

## Usage within forms

To use slider within forms, use the exposed `getInputProps` from the `connect`
function and ensure you pass `name` value to the machine's context. It will
render a hidden input for each value and ensure the value changes get propagated
to the form correctly.

```jsx {3}
const [state, send] = useMachine(
  rangeSlider.machine({
    name: "quantity",
  }),
)
```

## RTL Support

The slider has built-in support for RTL alignment and interaction. In the RTL
mode, operations are performed from right to left, meaning, the left arrow key
will increment and the right arrow key will decrement.

To enable RTL support, pass the `dir: rtl` context property

```jsx {3}
const [state, send] = useMachine(
  rangeSlider.machine({
    dir: "rtl",
  }),
)
```

> While we take care of the interactions in RTL mode, you'll have to ensure you
> apply the correct CSS styles to flip the layout.


## Styling guide

Earlier, we mentioned that each slider part has a `data-part` attribute added to
them to select and style them in the DOM.

### Focused State

When the slider thumb is focused, the `data-focus` attribute is added to the
root, control, thumb and label parts.

```css
[data-part="root"][data-focus] {
  /* styles for root focus state */
}

[data-part="thumb"]:focus {
  /* styles for thumb focus state */
}

[data-part="control"][data-focus] {
  /* styles for control focus state */
}

[data-part="track"][data-focus] {
  /* styles for track focus state */
}

[data-part="range"][data-focus] {
  /* styles for range focus state */
}
```

### Disabled State

When the slider is disabled, the `data-disabled` attribute is added to the root,
label, control and thumb.

```css
[data-part="root"][data-disabled] {
  /* styles for root disabled state */
}

[data-part="label"][data-disabled] {
  /* styles for label disabled state */
}

[data-part="control"][data-disabled] {
  /* styles for control disabled state */
}

[data-part="output"][data-disabled] {
  /* styles for output disabled state */
}

[data-part="thumb"][data-disabled] {
  /* styles for thumb disabled state */
}

[data-part="range"][data-disabled] {
  /* styles for range disabled state */
}
```

### Orientation

```css
[data-part="root"][data-orientation="(horizontal|vertical)"] {
  /* styles for horizontal or vertical  */
}

[data-part="thumb"][data-orientation="(horizontal|vertical)"] {
  /* styles for horizontal or vertical  */
}

[data-part="track"][data-orientation="(horizontal|vertical)"] {
  /* styles for horizontal or vertical  */
}
```

## Methods and Properties

The range slider's `api` provides properties and methods you can use to
programmatically read and set the slider's value.
