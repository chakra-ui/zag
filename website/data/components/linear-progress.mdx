# Progress

Progress is a simple progress bar that can be used to show the progress of a
task such as downloading a file, uploading an image, etc.

<Resources pkg="@zag-js/progress" />

<Showcase id="LinearProgress" />

**Features**

- Support for linear and circular progress bars.
- Support for minimum and maximum values.
- Support for indeterminate progress bars.

## Installation

To use the progress machine in your project, run the following command in your
command line:

<CodeSnippet id="progress/installation.mdx" />

This command will install the framework agnostic progress logic and the reactive
utilities for your framework of choice.

## Anatomy

To set up the progress correctly, you'll need to understand its anatomy and how
we name its parts.

> Each part includes a `data-part` attribute to help identify them in the DOM.

<Anatomy id="linear-progress" />

## Usage

First, import the progress package into your project

```jsx
import * as progress from "@zag-js/progress"
```

The progress package exports two key functions:

- `machine` â€” The state machine logic for the progress widget.
- `connect` â€” The function that translates the machine's state to JSX attributes
  and event handlers.

> You'll also need to provide a unique `id` to the `useMachine` hook. This is
> used to ensure that every part has a unique identifier.

Next, import the required hooks and functions for your framework and use the
progress machine in your project ðŸ”¥

<CodeSnippet id="progress/usage.mdx" />

## Setting the value

Use the `api.setValue` method to set the value of the progress bar.

```jsx {3}
const [state, send] = useMachine(
  progress.machine({
    value: 50,
  }),
)
```

## Setting the minimum and maximum values

By default, the progress bar has a minimum value of `0` and a maximum value of
`100`. You can change these values by passing the `min` and `max` options to the
machine.

```jsx {3-4}
const [state, send] = useMachine(
  progress.machine({
    min: 0,
    max: 1000,
  }),
)
```

## Using the indeterminate state

The progress component is determinate by default, with the value and max set to
`50` and `100` respectively.

Set `value` to `null` to indicate an indeterminate value for operations whose
progress can't be determined (e.g., attempting to reconnect to a server).

```jsx {3}
const [state, send] = useMachine(
  progress.machine({
    value: null,
  }),
)
```

## Showing a value text

Progress bars can only be interpreted by sighted users. To include a text
description to support assistive technologies like screen readers, use the
`valueText` part.

```jsx
const [state, send] = useMachine(
  progress.machine({
    translations: {
      valueText: ({ value, max }) =>
        value == null ? "Loading..." : `${value} of ${max} items loaded`,
    },
  }),
)
```

Then you need to render the `valueText` part in your component.

```jsx
<div {...api.getValueTextProps()}>{api.valueAsString}</div>
```

## Styling guide

Earlier, we mentioned that each menu part has a `data-part` attribute added to
them to select and style them in the DOM.

```css
[data-scope="progress"][data-part="root"] {
  /* Styles for the root part */
}

[data-scope="progress"][data-part="track"] {
  /* Styles for the track part */
}

[data-scope="progress"][data-part="range"] {
  /* Styles for the range part */
}
```

### Indeterminate state

To style the indeterminate state, you can use the `[data-state=indeterminate]`
selector.

```css
[data-scope="progress"][data-part="root"][data-state="indeterminate"] {
  /* Styles for the root indeterminate state */
}

[data-scope="progress"][data-part="track"][data-state="indeterminate"] {
  /* Styles for the root indeterminate state */
}

[data-scope="progress"][data-part="range"][data-state="indeterminate"] {
  /* Styles for the root indeterminate state */
}
```

## Methods and Properties
