# Dialog

A dialog is a window overlaid on either the primary window or another dialog
window. Content behind a modal dialog is inert, meaning that users cannot
interact with it.

<Resources pkg="@zag-js/dialog" />

<Showcase id="Dialog" />

**Features**

- Supports modal and non-modal modes.
- Focus is trapped and scrolling is blocked in the modal mode.
- Provides screen reader announcements via rendered title and description.
- Pressing `Esc` closes the dialog.

## Installation

To use the dialog machine in your project, run the following command in your
command line:

<CodeSnippet id="dialog/installation.mdx" />

This command will install the framework agnostic dialog logic and the reactive
utilities for your framework of choice.

## Anatomy

To use the dialog component correctly, you'll need to understand its anatomy and
how we name its parts.

> Each part includes a `data-part` attribute to help identify them in the DOM.

<Anatomy id="dialog" />

The dialog pattern consists of:

- **Trigger**: The button that triggers the dialog
- **Backdrop**: The dim background overlay that's usually behind the dialog
  element.
- **Container**: The container for the dialog's content.
- **Content**: Used to house the content of the dialog.

The dialog's content consists of:

- **Title**: The title of the dialog.
- **Description**: The description that supports the title.
- **Close Button**: The button used to close the dialog.

## Usage

First, import the dialog package into your project

```jsx
import * as dialog from "@zag-js/dialog"
```

The dialog package exports two key functions:

- `machine` â€” The state machine logic for the dialog widget as described in
  WAI-ARIA specification.
- `connect` â€” The function that translates the machine's state to JSX attributes
  and event handlers.

> You'll need to provide a unique `id` to the `useMachine` hook. This is used to
> ensure that every part has a unique identifier.

Next, import the required hooks and functions for your framework and use the
dialog machine in your project ðŸ”¥

<CodeSnippet id="dialog/usage.mdx" />


## Managing focus within the dialog

When the dialog opens, it automatically sets focus on the first focusable
elements and traps focus within it, so that tabbing is constrained to it.

To control the element that should receive focus on open, pass the
`initialFocusEl` context (which can be an element or a function that returns an
element)

<CodeSnippet id="dialog/initial-focus.mdx" />

To set the element that receives focus when the dialog closes, pass the
`finalFocusEl` in the similar fashion as shown above.

## Closing the dialog on overlay click

By default, the dialog closes when you click its overlay. You can set
`closeOnOutsideClick` to `false` if you want the modal to stay visible.

```jsx {3}
const [state, send] = useMachine(
  dialog.machine({
    closeOnOutsideClick: false,
  }),
)
```

## Controlling the scroll behavior

When the dialog is open, it prevents scrolling on the `body` element. To disable
this behavior, set the `preventScroll` context to `false`.

```jsx {3}
const [state, send] = useMachine(
  dialog.machine({
    preventScroll: false,
  }),
)
```

## Creating an Alert dialog

The dialog has support for dialog and alert dialog roles. It's set to `dialog`
by default. To change it's role, pass the `role: alertdialog` property to the
machine's context.

That's it! Now you have an alert dialog.

```jsx {3}
const [state, send] = useMachine(
  dialog.machine({
    role: "alertdialog",
  }),
)
```

> By definition, an alert dialog will contain two or more action buttons. We
> recommended setting focus to the least destructive action via `initialFocusEl`

## Styling guide

Earlier, we mentioned that each accordion part has a `data-part` attribute added
to them to select and style them in the DOM.

```css
[data-part="trigger"] {
  /* styles for the trigger element */
}

[data-part="backdrop"] {
  /* styles for the backdrop element */
}

[data-part="container"] {
  /* styles for the container element */
}

[data-part="content"] {
  /* styles for the content element */
}

[data-part="title"] {
  /* styles for the title element */
}

[data-part="description"] {
  /* styles for the description element */
}

[data-part="close-trigger"] {
  /* styles for the close trigger element */
}
```

## Methods and Properties
