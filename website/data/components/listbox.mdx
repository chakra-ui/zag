# Listbox

A listbox component that displays a list of selectable options, supporting both
single and multiple selection modes.

<Resources pkg="@zag-js/listbox" />

<Showcase id="Listbox" />

**Features**

- Supports single, multiple, or no selection
- Can be controlled or uncontrolled
- Fully managed keyboard navigation (arrow keys, home, end, etc.)
- Vertical and horizontal orientation
- Typeahead to allow focusing the matching item
- Supports items, labels, groups of items
- Supports grid and list layouts

## Installation

To use the listbox machine in your project, run the following command in your
command line:

<CodeSnippet id="listbox/installation.mdx" />

## Anatomy

To set up the listbox correctly, you'll need to understand its anatomy and how
we name its parts.

> Each part includes a `data-part` attribute to help identify them in the DOM.

<Anatomy id="listbox" />

## Usage

First, import the listbox package into your project

```jsx
import * as listbox from "@zag-js/listbox"
```

The listbox package exports two key functions:

- `machine` â€” The state machine logic for the listbox widget.
- `connect` â€” The function that translates the machine's state to JSX attributes
  and event handlers.

> You'll also need to provide a unique `id` to the `useMachine` hook. This is
> used to ensure that every part has a unique identifier.

Next, import the required hooks and functions for your framework and use the
listbox machine in your project ðŸ”¥

<CodeSnippet id="listbox/usage.mdx" />

## Setting the initial selection

To set the initial selection, you can use the `defaultValue` property.

```tsx
const service = useMachine(listbox.machine, {
  // ...
  defaultValue: ["item-1", "item-2"],
})
```

## Controlling the selection

To control the selection programmatically, you can use the `value` and
`onValueChange` properties.

```tsx
const service = useMachine(listbox.machine, {
  value: ["item-1", "item-2"],
  onValueChange: (value) => {
    console.log(value)
  },
})
```

## Filtering

The listbox component supports filtering of items via `api.getInputProps`.
Here's an example of how to support searching through a list of items.

<CodeSnippet id="listbox/filtering.mdx" />

## Selecting multiple items

To enable multiple selection, set the `selectionMode` property to `multiple` or
`extended`.

```tsx
const service = useMachine(listbox.machine, {
  // ...
  selectionMode: "multiple",
})
```

## Selection Modes

By default, a user can select a single item in a listbox. You can set the
`selectionMode` property to a SelectionMode enumeration value to enable
multi-selection. Here are the selection mode values.

- **single**: A user can select a single item using the space bar, mouse click,
  or touch tap.
- **multiple**: A user can select multiple items using the space bar, mouse
  click, or touch tap to toggle selection on the focused item. Using the arrow
  keys, a user can move focus independently of selection.
- **extended**: With no modifier keys like `Ctrl`, `Cmd` or `Shift`: the
  behavior is the same as single selection.

```tsx
const service = useMachine(listbox.machine, {
  // ...
  selectionMode: "extended",
})
```

## Disabling items

To disable an item, you can use the `disabled` property.

```tsx
api.getItemProps({
  // ...
  disabled: true,
})
```

To disable the entire listbox, you can use the `disabled` property.

```tsx
const service = useMachine(listbox.machine, {
  disabled: true,
})
```

## Grid layout

To enable a grid layout, provide a grid collection to the `collection` property.

```tsx
const service = useMachine(listbox.machine, {
  collection: listbox.gridCollection({
    items: [],
    columnCount: 3,
  }),
})
```

<CodeSnippet id="listbox/grid-usage.mdx" />

## Styling guide

Earlier, we mentioned that each listbox part has a `data-part` attribute added
to them to select and style them in the DOM.

```css
[data-scope="listbox"][data-part="root"] {
  /* styles for the root part */
}

[data-scope="listbox"][data-part="label"] {
  /* styles for the label part */
}

[data-scope="listbox"][data-part="content"] {
  /* styles for the content part */
}

[data-scope="listbox"][data-part="item"] {
  /* styles for the item part */
}

[data-scope="listbox"][data-part="itemGroup"] {
  /* styles for the item group part */
}
```

### Focused state

The focused state is applied to the item that is currently focused.

```css
[data-scope="listbox"][data-part="item"][data-focused] {
  /* styles for the focused item part */
}
```

### Selected state

The selected state is applied to the item that is currently selected.

```css
[data-scope="listbox"][data-part="item"][data-selected] {
  /* styles for the selected item part */
}
```

### Disabled state

The disabled state is applied to the item that is currently disabled.

```css
[data-scope="listbox"][data-part="item"][data-disabled] {
  /* styles for the disabled item part */
}
```
