# Collapsible

A collapsible is a component which expands and collapses a panel.

<Resources pkg="@zag-js/collapsible" />

<Showcase id="Collapsible" />

**Features**

- Full keyboard navigation.

## Installation

To use the collapsible machine in your project, run the following command in
your command line:

<CodeSnippet id="collapsible/installation.mdx" />

This command will install the framework agnostic collapsible logic and the
reactive utilities for your framework of choice.

## Usage

First, import the collapsible package into your project

```jsx
import * as collapsible from "@zag-js/collapsible"
```

The collapsible package exports two key functions:

- `machine` â€” The state machine logic for the collapsible widget.
- `connect` â€” The function that translates the machine's state to JSX attributes
  and event handlers.

> You'll also need to provide a unique `id` to the `useMachine` hook. This is
> used to ensure that every part has a unique identifier.

Next, import the required hooks and functions for your framework and use the
collapsible machine in your project ðŸ”¥

<CodeSnippet id="collapsible/usage.mdx" />

## Listening for changes

When the collapsible state changes, the `onOpenChange` callback is invoked.

```jsx {3-6}
const [state, send] = useMachine(
  collapsible.machine({
    onOpenChange(details) {
      // details => { open: boolean }
      console.log("collapsible open:", details.open)
    },
  }),
)
```

## Disabling the entire collapsible

You can disable the entire collapsible by passing `disabled` to the machine's
context.

When a collapsible is disabled, it is skipped from keyboard navigation and can't
be interacted with.

```jsx {3}
const [state, send] = useMachine(
  collapsible.machine({
    disabled: true,
  }),
)
```

## Animating the collapsible

You can animate the collapsible by passing `animate` to the machine's context.

When a collapsible is animated, you need to pass the `expandAnimationName` and
`collapseAnimationName` which are names of the keyframes you have in your CSS.

You can also pass the `animationDuration` which is the duration of the animation
in milliseconds (by default `300` milliseconds).

```jsx {3-6}
const [state, send] = useMachine(
  collapsible.machine({
    animate: true,
    expandAnimationName: "slideDown",
    collapseAnimationName: "slideUp",
    animationDuration: 300,
  }),
)
```

## Styling guide

Earlier, we mentioned that each collapsible part has a `data-part` attribute
added to them to select and style them in the DOM.

### Open and closed state

When a collapsible is expanded or collapsed, a `data-state` attribute is set on
the root, trigger and content elements. This attribute is removed when it is
closed.

```css
[data-part="root"][data-state="open|closed"] {
  /* styles for the collapsible is open or closed state */
}

[data-part="trigger"][data-state="open|closed"] {
  /* styles for the collapsible is open or closed state */
}

[data-part="content"][data-state="open|closed"] {
  /* styles for the collapsible is open or closed state */
}
```

### Focused state

When a collapsible's trigger is focused, a `data-focused` attribute is set on
the root, trigger and content.

```css
[data-part="root"][data-focus] {
  /* styles for the item's focus state */
}

[data-part="trigger"][data-focus] {
  /* styles for the content's focus state */
}

[data-part="content"][data-focus] {
  /* styles for the content's focus state */
}
```
