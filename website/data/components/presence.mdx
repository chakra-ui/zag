# Presence

The presence machine is a state machine that helps you manage exit animations in
your project.

In the DOM, when a component is removed from the tree or hidden, it's removed
instantly. The presence machine suspends the component to allow its exit
animation before removing or hiding it.

> The presence machine requires using **CSS animations** to animate the
> component's exit.

<Resources pkg="@zag-js/presence" />

<Showcase id="Presence" />

## Installation

To use the presence machine in your project, run the following command in your
command line:

<CodeSnippet id="presence/installation.mdx" />

This command will install the framework agnostic presence logic and the reactive
utilities for your framework of choice.

## Usage

First, import the presence package into your project

```jsx
import * as presence from "@zag-js/presence"
```

The presence package exports two key functions:

- `machine` â€” The state machine logic for the presence.
- `connect` â€” The function that translates the machine's state to JSX attributes
  and event handlers.

Next, import the required hooks and functions for your framework and use the
presence machine in your project ðŸ”¥

<CodeSnippet id="presence/usage.mdx" />

## Styling guide

To style any entry and exit animations, set up the `@keyframes` and apply the
animations.

```css
@keyframes enter {
  from {
    scale: 0.9;
    opacity: 0;
  }

  to {
    opacity: 1;
    scale: 1;
  }
}

@keyframes exit {
  to {
    opacity: 0;
    scale: 0.9;
  }
}

[data-state="open"] {
  animation: enter 0.15s ease-out;
}

[data-state="closed"] {
  animation: exit 0.1s ease-in;
}
```

You can then use the `Presence` component in your project.

```jsx
function Example() {
  const [open, setOpen] = React.useState(true)
  return (
    <>
      <button onClick={() => setOpen((c) => !c)}>Toggle</button>
      <Presence present={open} unmountOnExit>
        <div>Content</div>
      </Presence>
    </>
  )
}
```
