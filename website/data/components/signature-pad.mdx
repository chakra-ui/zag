# Signature Pad

The signature pad component allows users to draw handwritten signatures using
touch or pointer devices. The signature can be saved as an image or cleared.

## Listening to drawing events

The signature pad component emits the following events:

- `onDraw`: Emitted when the user is drawing the signature.
- `onDrawEnd`: Emitted when the user stops drawing the signature.

```jsx
const [state, send] = useMachine(
  signature.machine({
    onDraw(details) {
      // details => { path: string[] }
      console.log("Drawing signature", details)
    },
    onDrawEnd(details) {
      // details => { path: string[], toDataURL: () => string }
      console.log("Signature drawn", details)
    },
  }),
)
```

## Clearing the signature

To clear the signature, use the `api.clear()`, or render the clear trigger
button.

```jsx
<button onClick={() => api.clear()}>Clear</button>
```

## Rendering an image preview

Use the `api.getDataUrl()` method to get the signature as a data URL and render
it as an image.

> You can also leverage the `onDrawEnd` event to get the signature data URL.

## Changing the stroke color

To change the stroke color, set the `drawing.fill` option to a valid CSS color.

> Note: You can't use a css variable as the stroke color.

```jsx
const [state, send] = useMachine(
  signature.machine({
    drawing: {
      fill: "red",
    },
  }),
)
```

## Changing the stroke width

To change the stroke width, set the `drawing.size` option to a number.

```jsx
const [state, send] = useMachine(
  signature.machine({
    drawing: {
      size: 5,
    },
  }),
)
```

## Simulating pressure sensitivity

Pressure sensitivity is disabled by default. To enable it, set the
`drawing.simulatePressure` option to `true`.

```jsx
const [state, send] = useMachine(
  signature.machine({
    drawing: {
      simulatePressure: true,
    },
  }),
)
```

## Usage in forms

To use the signature pad in a form, set the `name` context property and render
the hidden input element using `api.hiddenInputProps`.

```jsx
const [state, send] = useMachine(
  signature.machine({
    name: "signature",
  }),
)
```

## Disabling the signature pad

Set the `disabled` context property to `true` to disable the signature pad.

```jsx
const [state, send] = useMachine(
  signature.machine({
    disabled: true,
  }),
)
```

## Making the signature pad read-only

Set the `readOnly` context property to `true` to make the signature pad
read-only.

```jsx
const [state, send] = useMachine(
  signature.machine({
    readOnly: true,
  }),
)
```
