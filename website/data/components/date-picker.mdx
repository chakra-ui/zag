# Date Picker

A datepicker allows users to enter a date either through text input, or by
choosing a date from the calendar.

> **Good to know**: The date picker machine is built around the
> [ISO 8601 date format](https://www.iso.org/iso-8601-date-and-time-format.html)

<Resources pkg="@zag-js/date-picker" />

<Showcase id="DatePicker" />

**Features**

- Displays a calendar view for date selection
- Support for date range selection
- Support for disabling specific dates
- Localization support
- Provides keyboard accessibility for navigating the calendar.

## Installation

To use the date-picker machine in your project, run the following command in
your command line:

<CodeSnippet id="date-picker/installation.mdx" />

This command will install the framework agnostic date-picker logic and the
reactive utilities for your framework of choice.

## Anatomy

To set up the date-picker correctly, you'll need to understand its anatomy and
how we name its parts.

> Each part includes a `data-part` attribute to help identify them in the DOM.

<Anatomy id="date-picker" />

## Usage

First, import the date picker package into your project

```jsx
import * as datepicker from "@zag-js/date-picker"
```

The date picker package exports these key functions:

- `machine` â€” The state machine logic for the date-picker widget.
- `connect` â€” The function that translates the machine's state to JSX attributes
  and event handlers.
- `parse` - The function that parses the date string into a date object. This
  function uses
  [`@internationalized/date`](https://react-spectrum.adobe.com/internationalized/date/CalendarDate.html)
  under the hood.

> You'll also need to provide a unique `id` to the `useMachine` hook. This is
> used to ensure that every part has a unique identifier.

Next, import the required hooks and functions for your framework and use the
date-picker machine in your project ðŸ”¥

<CodeSnippet id="date-picker/usage.mdx" />

## Setting the initial date

To set the initial value that is rendered by the date picker, set the `value`
property in the machine context.

```jsx
const [state, send] = useMachine(
  datepicker.machine({
    value: datepicker.parse("2022-01-01"),
  }),
)
```

## Controlling the selected date

Use the `api.setValue` method to control the selected date in the DatePicker
component.

```jsx
// parse the date string into a date object
const nextValue = datepicker.parse("2022-01-01")

// set the new value
api.setValue(nextValue)
```

> Alternatively, you can also use the `value` and `onValueChange` callbacks to
> programmatically control the selected date.

## Controlling the open state

To manage the open state of the datepicker's dialog, we recommended using
`api.setOpen` method.

```jsx
// open the date picker
api.setOpen(true)

// close the date picker
api.setOpen(false)
```

> Alternatively, you can also use the `open` and `onOpenChange` callbacks to
> programmatically control the open state.

## Setting the min and max dates

To constrain the date range that can be selected by the user, set the `min` and
`max` properties in the machine context.

```jsx
const [state, send] = useMachine(
  datepicker.machine({
    min: datepicker.parse("2022-01-01"),
    max: datepicker.parse("2022-12-31"),
  }),
)
```

When the min or max date value is reached, the next and prev triggers will be
disabled.

## Changing the start of the week

Set the `startOfWeek` property in the machine context to change the start of the
week. The property accepts a number from `0` to `6`, where `0` is Sunday and `6`
is Saturday.

```jsx
const [state, send] = useMachine(
  datepicker.machine({
    startOfWeek: 1, // Monday
  }),
)
```

## Disabling the date picker

To disable the date picker, set the `disabled` property in the machine context
to `true`.

```jsx
const [state, send] = useMachine(
  datepicker.machine({
    disabled: true,
  }),
)
```

## Rendering month and year pickers

To render the month and year pickers, use the `api.getMonthSelectProps` and
`api.getYearSelectProps` prop getters.

```jsx
<div>
  <select {...api.getMonthSelectProps()}>
    {api.getMonths().map((month, i) => (
      <option key={i} value={month.value}>
        {month.label}
      </option>
    ))}
  </select>

  <select {...api.getYearSelectProps()}>
    {getYearsRange({ from: 1_000, to: 4_000 }).map((year, i) => (
      <option key={i} value={year}>
        {year}
      </option>
    ))}
  </select>
</div>
```

## Marking unavailable dates

To mark specific dates as unavailable, set the `isDateUnavailable` function in
the machine context. This function should return `true` for dates that are
unavailable.

```jsx
const [state, send] = useMachine(
  datepicker.machine({
    isDateUnavailable: (date, locale) => {
      // mark weekends as unavailable
      return date.day === 0 || date.day === 6
    },
  }),
)
```

You can also leverage the numerous helpers from
[`@internationalized/date`](https://react-spectrum.adobe.com/internationalized/date/CalendarDate.html)
to create more complex date availability rules.

```jsx
import { isWeekend } from "@internationalized/date"

const [state, send] = useMachine(
  datepicker.machine({
    isDateUnavailable: (date, locale) => {
      // mark weekends as unavailable
      return isWeekend(date, locale)
    },
  }),
)
```

## Setting the calendar starting view

The calendar view is set to `day` by default. To change the starting view of the
calendar, set the `view` property in the machine context to either `day`,
`month`, or `year`.

```jsx
const [state, send] = useMachine(
  datepicker.machine({
    view: "month",
  }),
)
```

## Setting the read-only mode

Set the `readOnly` property in the machine context to `true` to make the date
picker read-only. This means that users can't change the selected date.

```jsx
const [state, send] = useMachine(
  datepicker.machine({
    readOnly: true,
  }),
)
```

## Setting the focused date

The datepicker's focused date is set to either the first selected date or
today's date by default.

To change the focused date, set the `focusedDate` property in the machine
context.

```jsx
const [state, send] = useMachine(
  datepicker.machine({
    focusedDate: datepicker.parse("2022-01-01"),
  }),
)
```

## Rendering the calendar inline

To render the calendar inline, we recommended setting the `open` property to
`true` and `closeOnSelect` to `false`.

```jsx
const [state, send] = useMachine(
  datepicker.machine({
    open: true,
    "open.controlled": true,
    closeOnSelect: false,
  }),
)
```

## Usage within a form

To use the date picker within a form, set the `name` property in the machine
context. This property is used to identify the date picker in the form data.

```jsx
const [state, send] = useMachine(
  datepicker.machine({
    name: "date",
  }),
)
```

## Rendering fixed number of weeks

The datepicker's calendar will render the weeks needed to display all of the
days in the month. Sometimes this can result in a jump in the UI when navigating
between different sized months (e.g., February vs. March).

To ensure the calendar renders the maximum number of weeks (6), you can set the
`fixedWeeks` prop to `true`.

```jsx
const [state, send] = useMachine(
  datepicker.machine({
    fixedWeeks: true,
  }),
)
```

## Listening to date changes

To listen to date changes, use the `onValueChange` callback in the machine
context.

```jsx
const [state, send] = useMachine(
  datepicker.machine({
    onValueChange(details) {
      // details => { value: DateValue[], valueAsString: string[], view: string }
      console.log("selected date:", details.valueAsString)
    },
  }),
)
```

## Listening to view changes

When the calendar view changes by click on the view controls, the `onViewChange`
callback is invoked.

```jsx
const [state, send] = useMachine(
  datepicker.machine({
    onViewChange(details) {
      // details => { view: string }
      console.log("view changed to:", details.view)
    },
  }),
)
```

## Styling guide

Earlier, we mentioned that each date-picker part has a `data-part` attribute
added to them to select and style them in the DOM.

```css
[data-scope="date-picker"][data-part="root"] {
  /* styles for the root part */
}

[data-scope="date-picker"][data-part="input"] {
  /* styles for the input part */
}

[data-scope="date-picker"][data-part="trigger"] {
  /* styles for the trigger part */
}

[data-scope="date-picker"][data-part="content"] {
  /* styles for the input part */
}
```

### Open State

```css
[data-scope="date-picker"][data-part="trigger"] {
  &[data-state="open"] {
    /* styles for the open state */
  }

  &[data-state="closed"] {
    /* styles for the closed state */
  }
}
```

### Cell States

```css
[data-scope="date-picker"][data-part="table-cell-trigger"] {
  /* styles for the cell */

  &[data-selected] {
    /* styles for the selected date */
  }

  &[data-focus] {
    /* styles for the focused date */
  }

  &[data-disabled] {
    /* styles for the disabled date */
  }

  &[data-unavailable] {
    /* styles for the unavailable date */
  }

  &[data-today] {
    /* styles for the today date */
  }

  &[data-weekend] {
    /* styles for the weekend date */
  }
}
```
