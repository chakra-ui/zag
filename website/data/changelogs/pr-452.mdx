## Patch Changes

### All packages

- Updated packages to use explicit `exports` field in `package.json`

### Anatomy `0.1.3`

- Fixed build issue where emitted types was large and incorrect.

### Core `0.2.4`

- Aded support for custom equality function for `watch` property keys.

> This is done via the `compareFns` option.

This is useful for comparing complex objects or dates, to avoid unnecessary context updates.

```js
const machine = createMachine(
  {
    context: {
      date: new Date(),
    },
    watch: {
      date: ["invokeOnDateChange"],
    },
  },
  {
    compareFns: {
      date: (a, b) => a.getTime() === b.getTime(),
    },
  },
)
```

### Menu `0.3.3`

- Support the use of `Tab` key press to navigate through the menu items.

### Pin Input `0.2.7`

- Fixed issue where input had multiple characters in controlled mode
- Fixed infinite loop error when value changes in controlled mode

### Focus Visible `0.2.1`

- Fixed issue where `:focus-visible` query throw a `SyntaxError` in Jest
