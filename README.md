# Zag

Finite state machines for accessible JavaScript components

- **Write once, use everywhere 🦄**: The component interactions are modelled in a framework agnostic way. We provide
  adapters for JS frameworks like React, Solid, or Vue.
- **Focus on accessibility ♿️**: Zag is built with accessibility in mind. We handle many details related to keyboard
  interactions, focus management, aria roles and attributes.
- **Headless ✨**: The machine APIs are completely unstyled and gives you the control to use any styling solution you
  prefer.
- **Powered by state machines 🌳**: Zag is built on top of the latest ideas in Statecharts. We don't follow the SCXML
  specifications, but we've created an API that we think will help us build more complex components fast.

## Problem

With the rise of design systems and component-driven development, there's an endless re-implementation of common
component patterns (Tabs, Menu, Modal, etc.) in multiple frameworks.

Most of these implementations seem to be fairly similar in spirit, the differences being around the reactivity and
effects systems for the framework (e.g. `useState`, `useEffect` in React.js). Framework specific solutions tend to grow
in complexity over time and often become hard to understand, debug, improve or test.

## Solution

**Zag** is a JavaScript API that implements common component patterns using the state machine methodology.

### Installation

```sh
npm i --save @zag-js/{component}

# or

yarn add @zag-js/{component}
```

> `{component}` represents any component machine like dialog (`@zag-js/dialog`), tooltip (`@zag-js/tooltip`) , etc.

For framework specific solutions, we provide simple wrappers to help you consume the component state machines.

- ⚛️ `@zag-js/react` - React hooks for consuming machines in React applications
- 💚 `@zag-js/vue` - Vue composition for consuming machines in Vue applications
- 🎷 `@zag-js/solid` - Solid.js utilities for consuming machines in Solid.js applications

## Usage

```jsx
import { normalizeProps, useMachine } from "@zag-js/react"
import * as toggle from "@zag-js/toggle-group"
import { useId } from "react"

export function ToggleGroup() {
  const [state, send] = useMachine(toggle.machine({ id: useId() }))
  const api = toggle.connect(state, send, normalizeProps)

  return (
    <div {...api.rootProps}>
      <button {...api.getItemProps({ value: "bold" })}>B</button>
      <button {...api.getItemProps({ value: "italic" })}>I</button>
      <button {...api.getItemProps({ value: "underline" })}>U</button>
    </div>
  )
}
```

## Guiding Principles

- All component machines and tests are modelled according to the
  [WAI-ARIA authoring practices](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-practices/)
- Write end-to-end tests for every component based on the WAI-ARIA spec. **Regardless of the framework, users expect
  component patterns to work the same way!**
- All machines should be light-weight, simple, and easy to understand. Avoid using complex machine concepts like spawn,
  nested states, etc.

---

## Fun Facts

**Zag** means to _take a sharp change in direction_. This clearly describes our approach of using state machines to
power the logic behind UI components.

### Teasers

- When you see someone using classic react, vue or solid to build an interactive UI component that exists in Zag, tell
  them to **"zag it!"** ⚡️

- Anyone using Zag will be called a **"zagger"** 💥

- The feeling you get when you use Zag will be called **"zagadat!"** 🚀

- The Zag community will be called **"zag nation"** 🔥

## Commands

### Build commands

Our build is managed with esbuild and turborepo to provide fast, concurrent builds across the packages.

- `build` : Build the CJS, ESM and DTS files. This is the actual production build that we run in the CI.

### Examples

Since zag is framework agnostic, we need a way to test it within a framework. The `examples/` directory includes starter
projects for the frameworks we support.

- `start-react` : Starts the Next.js TypeScript project
- `start-vue` : Starts the Vue 3 TypeScript project
- `start-solid` : Starts the Solid TypeScript project

### E2E Tests

We've setup end-to-end tests for every machine we built. We use [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/) for testing and we
ensure that the component works the same way regardless of the framework.

- `e2e-react` : Starts the E2E tests for the React project
- `e2e-vue` : Starts the E2E tests for the Vue project
- `e2e-solid` : Starts the E2E tests for the Solid project

### Contributing new machines/features

- `generate-machine` : Generates a new machine package in the `packages/` directory. It sets up the required files and
  structure for new machine.
- `generate-util` : Generates a new utility package in the `packages/utilities` directory.

### Other commands

- `test` : Run the tests for all packages
- `lint` : Lint all packages

### Website

- `start-website`: Starts the website
